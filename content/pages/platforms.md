Neon makes it easy to embed Postgres into your platform with one-second provisioning, autoscaling, and scale-to-zero—so each user gets an isolated database without the overhead. Databases are provisioned via API and fully integrated into your product, with no Neon signup or setup required.

## Uniquely built to scale Postgres fleets

Neon is the best Postgres provider for deploying one-database-per-user fleets at scale. **You don’t need a DevOps team to manage a large Neon fleet** – the Neon API lets you track usage, enforce limits, and scale programmatically. With pay-per-use pricing and automatic scale-to-zero, [you’ll spend a fraction of what you'd pay on AWS](/cost-fleets). What you get:

- Dedicated connection strings for every user or project - every user gets their own secure, isolated Postgres [project](/docs/manage/projects)
- High connection capacity - pooled endpoints support up to 10,000 connections
- Full Postgres compatibility - no proprietary query layer
- Custom branching and PITR - instant copies and rollbacks, no manual backups
- All of this is available across multiple regions, with autoscaling and high availability

## With instant provisioning and scale-to-zero

[Neon databases provision in less than a second](https://github.com/neondatabase/instant-postgres?tab=readme-ov-file#instant-postgres) and automatically suspend when idle, with no compute cost until the next query. **You can offer every user their own Postgres database without incurring the cost of idle infrastructure.** This is what makes Neon ideal for platforms: dedicated Postgres per user, but with shared-infrastructure economics.

- Provisioning time: ~1 second
- Suspend latency: configurable (default is 5 min)
- Resume latency (cold start): ~500ms

## API-first management

Neon’s API is purpose-built to help platforms manage large fleets of Postgres databases with minimal engineering effort. **We’ve continuously improved our API in collaboration with 20+ partners, each pushing the boundaries of scale and automation**. Via the Neon API, you can:

- Provision new databases instantly
- Set per-project resource limits to support free, pro, and enterprise plans
- Scale compute up or down per user or tier
- Automatically suspend inactive databases to reduce costs
- Monitor usage across thousands of projects
- Update quotas and configurations without downtime

…and more

## Built-in quotas and billing controls

Neon allows you to easily **define usage limits per project to manage cost and enforce pricing tiers**. As users upgrade or change plans, you can dynamically update limits via API, without downtime or user impact.

- Set maximum allowed storage
- Cap CPU usage
- Limit egress by plan
- Track and cap monthly data written
- Customize suspend timeouts for different tiers

## Tracking usage at scale

Neon also provides rich consumption APIs for observability at scale:

| Endpoint                                             | Description                                                        | Availability                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account-level cumulative metrics                     | Granular project-level metrics                                     | Single project metrics                                    |
| Aggregate metrics across all projects in the account | Usage metrics per project at hourly, daily, or monthly granularity | Detailed metrics and quota info for an individual project |
| Scale and Business plans                             | Scale and Business plans                                           | All plans                                                 |

You can use these to:

- Monitor total usage across all projects for a billing period
- Break down metrics by project or time range (hourly, daily, monthly)
- Power usage-based billing or internal dashboards

## Built for your platform, not ours

**We’re not trying to own your user experience — we’re here to power it.** You can integrate Neon invisibly behind the scenes, whether you want to use our [OAuth integration](/docs/guides/oauth-integration) or manage Neon projects directly via API. **You decide how the database shows up in your UI, we take care of the rest.**
