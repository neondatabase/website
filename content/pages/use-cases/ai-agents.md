Neon is Postgres rearchitected for agent platforms, designed to give your users the best possible experience without bloating your infra. Let your users vibe-code full apps with a frictionless database and auth integration - provisioning happens instantly, no Neon login required.

Use Neon branching to build time travel and versioning features, so users can iterate and jump between versions of their apps. And thanks to Neon’s scale-to-zero, pay only for active databases.

<QuoteBlock quote="The speed of provisioning and serverless scale-to-zero of Neon is critical for us. We can serve users iterating on quick ideas efficiently while also supporting them as they scale, without making them think about database setup." author="dhruv-amin" role="Co-founder at Create.xyz" />

## The agent experience you can build with Neon

<FeatureList />

<QuoteBlock quote="Integrating Neon was a no-brainer. It gives every Databutton app a production-grade Postgres database in seconds, with zero overhead. Our AI agent can now create, manage, and debug the entire stack, not just code." author="martin-skow-røed" role="CTO and co-founder of Databutton" />

## AI Agents are now provisioning 80% of Neon databases (tens of thousands per day)

The scale is massive, and Neon is built to handle it.

The [Neon MCP server](https://mcp.neon.tech/) enables any client to interact with Neon's API using natural language. AI agents can use Neon's MCP server to automate tasks such as creating databases, running SQL queries, and managing database migrations. 

The [@neondatabase/toolkit](https://github.com/neondatabase/toolkit) is a lightweight client designed for AI agents that need to spin up Postgres databases in seconds and run SQL queries. It includes both the Neon TypeScript SDK and the Neon Serverless Driver.
