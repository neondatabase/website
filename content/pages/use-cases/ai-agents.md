From fast-paced prompting to launch, your users want to build and deploy apps, they shouldn't have to think about databases. Industry-leading AI Agent Codegen Platforms like Replit, V0, and many more provision and operate full-stack applications using Neon because it works seamlessly with new usage patterns of AI-generated apps. 

**Neon Features for Agents:**

- **Instant Provisioning:** your users never wait for infrastructure. 
- **Checkpointing:** toggle between code and database state for users.
- **Low cost-per-Database:**  automatic scale to zero and 350ms cold starts.
- **Full-Stack, Batteries-Included:** Neon Auth, Data API included at no added charge.
- **Granular API Controls:** Track and control usage for flexible limits and invoicing.

## How It Works

<FeatureList />

<QuoteBlock quote="Integrating Neon was a no-brainer. It gives every Databutton app a production-grade Postgres database in seconds, with zero overhead. Our AI agent can now create, manage, and debug the entire stack, not just code." author="martin-skow-røed" role="CTO and co-founder of Databutton" />

## Platform Scale

> **AI Agents are now provisioning 80% of Neon databases (tens of thousands per day)**


The scale is massive, and Neon is built to handle it.

The [Neon MCP server](https://mcp.neon.tech/) enables any client to interact with Neon's API using natural language. AI agents can use Neon's MCP server to automate tasks such as creating databases, running SQL queries, and managing database migrations. 

The [@neondatabase/toolkit](https://github.com/neondatabase/toolkit) is a lightweight client designed for AI agents that need to spin up Postgres databases in seconds and run SQL queries. It includes both the Neon TypeScript SDK and the Neon Serverless Driver.
