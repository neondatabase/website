Modern developer tooling has shortened software release cycles dramatically â€” but the database remains a bottleneck for most teams. Engineers still spend a disproportionate amount of time on tasks that should be automated or obsolete:

- **Seed file maintenance.** Keeping test data in sync across environments is painful and error-prone. Any schema change or data requirement forces manual updates and PR churn.
- **Manual environment setup.** End-to-end testing requires clean, isolated environments - but spinning up new database instances, loading schema, and importing seed data introduces costly delays.
- **Shared development databases.** When multiple developers share a single database, they run into concurrency issues, test conflicts, and overwritten data. Larger teams often end up duplicating environments just to stay productive.

These patterns slow down releases, reduce confidence in testing, and create friction between developers and operations teams.
