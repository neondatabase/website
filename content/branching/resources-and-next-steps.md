Neon branches set a powerful new standard to manage Postgres environments.
This guide introduced you to the core concepts, architecture patterns, and real-world workflows behind branching in Neon. From per-developer sandboxes to agent-managed snapshots and PR previews, branches give you infrastructure that keeps pace with your team and disappears when you’re done.

The best part? It’s easy to get started.

[Sign up for Neon](https://console.neon.tech/signup) (it’s free) and create your first project. In just a few minutes, you can spin up your first branch, run a test, preview an app, or connect to Vercel or GitHub Actions.
