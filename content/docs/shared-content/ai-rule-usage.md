## How to use

You can use these rules in two ways:

<Steps>
## Option 1: Copy from this page

Copy the rules below and save them to `.cursor/rules/neon-auth.mdc` in your project.

## Option 2: Clone from repository

If you prefer, you can clone or download the rules directly from our [AI Rules repository](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/ai-rules).

Once added to your project, AI tools will automatically use these rules when working with Neon Auth code. You can also reference them explicitly in prompts.
