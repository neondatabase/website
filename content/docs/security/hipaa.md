At Neon, we take the security and privacy of your health information seriously. This guide is designed to help you understand how Neon complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and what that means for you as a customer. Our Business Associate Agreement (BAA) outlines our commitment to safeguarding Protected Health Information (PHI) and complying with HIPAA regulations.

Neon's HIPAA functionality is only available to customers who have signed a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Neon. To request a draft BAA, please contact [Neon Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

## What is HIPAA?

HIPAA is a federal law that sets national standards for the protection of health information. It requires businesses handling PHI to implement safeguards to ensure privacy and security.

## Key HIPAA Terms You Should Know:

- Protected Health Information (PHI): Any identifiable health-related data.
- Covered Entity: Healthcare providers, plans, or clearinghouses that handle PHI.
- Business Associate: A service provider (like Neon) that handles PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity.
- Breach: Unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of PHI.
- Security Rule: Safeguards to protect electronic PHI.
- Privacy Rule: Rules governing how PHI is used and disclosed.

## How Neon Protects Your Data

5. Customer Responsibilities

   - Customers must ensure that PHI is only stored in data rows as intended for sensitive data and should never be included in metadata, column names, table names, schema descriptions, or system-generated logs such as audit trails, query logs, or error logs.
   - Customers have the responsibility to configure a session timeout.
   - Customers need to avoid including PHI in support tickets or metadata fields.
