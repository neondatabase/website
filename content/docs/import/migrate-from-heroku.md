This guide describes how to import your data from Heroku Postgres to Neon.

<MigrationAssistant/>

The instructions assume that you have installed the Heroku CLI, which is used to transfer data from Heroku. For installation instructions, see [The Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

<Steps>

## Create a Neon project and copy the connection string

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.
4. After creating a project, you are directed to the Neon **Dashboard**, where you can click **Connect** to find your database connection details. Copy the connection string. It is required to import your data from Heroku.

   The example connection string used the instructions that follow is:

   ```text shouldWrap
   postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
   ```

## Retrieve your Heroku app name and database name

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and select the project you want to import data from.
1. Select **Overview** and copy the name of the Heroku Postgres database, which appears under **Installed add-ons**.
1. Click **Settings** and copy your Heroku **App Name**.

<Admonition type="note">
You can also retrieve the Heroku Postgres database name using the following Heroku CLI command:
</Admonition>

```shell
heroku pg:links --app <app>
```

where `<app>` is the Heroku App Name.

For example:

```shell
$ heroku pg:links --app thawing-wave-57227
=== postgresql-trapezoidal-48645
```

## Import your data

From your terminal, run the following Heroku CLI command:

```shell
heroku pg:pull --app [app] [heroku-pg-database] [neon-connection-string]
```

where:

- `[app]` is the name of the Heroku app
- `[heroku-pg-database]` is the name of the Heroku PostgreSQL database
- `[neon-connection-string]` is the Neon connection string

For example:

```shell shouldWrap
$ heroku pg:pull --app thawing-wave-57227 postgresql-trapezoidal-48645 postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname

heroku-cli: Pulling postgresql-trapezoidal-48645 ---> postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname

## Verify that your data was imported

1. Log in to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
2. Select the Neon project that you transferred data to.
3. Select the **Tables** tab.
4. In the sidebar, verify that your database tables appear under the **Tables** heading.
