The following instructions require a working installation of [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). The `psql` client is the native command-line client for Postgres. It provides an interactive session for sending commands to Postgres and running ad-hoc queries. For more information about `psql`, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

<Admonition type="note">
A Neon compute runs Postgres, which means that any Postgres application or standard utility such as `psql` is compatible with Neon. You can also use Postgres client libraries and drivers to connect. However, please be aware that some older client libraries and drivers, including older `psql` executables, are built without [Server Name Indication (SNI)](/docs/reference/glossary#sni) support and require a workaround. For more information, see [Connection errors](/docs/connect/connection-errors).

Neon also provides a passwordless auth feature that uses `psql`. For more information, see [Passwordless auth](/docs/connect/passwordless-connect).

## How to install psql

If you don't have `psql` installed already, follow these steps to get set up:

<Tabs labels={["Mac", "Linux", "Windows"]}>

<TabItem>
```bash
brew install libpq
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-client
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
Download and install PostgreSQL from:

https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/

Ensure psql is included in the installation.

## Connect to Neon with psql

The easiest way to connect to Neon using `psql` is with a connection string.

You can obtain a connection string by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard** to open the **Connect to your database** modal. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details modal](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

From your terminal or command prompt, run the `psql` client with the connection string copied from the Neon **Dashboard**.

```bash shouldWrap
psql postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

<Admonition type="note">
Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption, but you can increase the level of protection using the `sslmode` parameter setting in your connection string. For instructions, see [Connect to Neon securely](/docs/connect/connect-securely).
</Admonition>

### Where do I obtain a password?

You can obtain a Neon connection string by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard** to open the **Connect to your database** modal.

### What port does Neon use?

Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`. If you need to specify the port in your connection string, you can do so as follows:

```bash shouldWrap
psql postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname][:port]/[dbname]
```

## Running queries

After establishing a connection, try running the following queries:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table AS SELECT now();
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

The following result set is returned:

```sql
SELECT 1
              now

(1 row)
```

## Meta-commands

The `psql` client supports a variety of meta-commands, which act like shortcuts for interacting with your database.

### Benefits of Meta-Commands

Meta-commands can significantly speed up your workflow by providing quick access to database schemas and other critical information without needing to write full SQL queries. They are especially useful for database management tasks, making it easier to handle administrative duties directly from the Neon Console.

### Available meta-commands

Here are some of the meta-commands that you can use with `psql`.

<Admonition type="note">
The Neon SQL Editor also supports meta-commands. See [Meta commands in the Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor#meta-commands).

## Running psql from the Neon CLI

If you have `psql` and the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli) installed, you can run `psql` commands directly from the Neon CLI using the `connection-string` command with the `--psql` option.

```bash
neon connection-string --psql -- -c "SELECT version()"
```

For more examples, see [Neon CLI commands â€” connection-string](/docs/reference/cli-connection-string).
