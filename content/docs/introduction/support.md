## Open a support ticket

[Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) and [Custom Plan](/docs/introduction/custom-plan) users can open a support ticket from the Neon console. Look for the **Support** link in the sidebar. It opens the **Create Support Ticket** modal, where you can describe your issue.

You can expect an initial response time of 2 business days, from 6am to 6pm Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8), Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays in the United States. For custom support solutions, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

Video chat requests and retail customer support inquiries can be submitted through a support ticket.

## Support email

If you're unable to access Neon's primary support channels (e.g., the support ticket form in the Neon Console or the Neon Community Forum), you can use the following email as a fallback:

**Email**: `support@neon.tech`

Response times might be longer than our primary channels, so we appreciate your patience.
