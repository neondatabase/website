<Admonition type="important">
The [Neon Discord Server](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) is available to all Neon users but is not an official Neon Support channel. If you are a paid plan user and require assistance from the Neon Support team, please open a support ticket, as described in [Standard support](#standard-support).

## Community support

Neon's [Free Plan](/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan) includes **Community** support.

Community support is provided through the [Neon Discord Server](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp), where you can ask questions or see what others are doing with Neon. You will find Neon users and members of the Neon team actively engaged in our Discord Server.

## Standard support

Neon's [Launch plan](/docs/introduction/plans#launch) includes **Standard** support.

Standard support includes access to the Neon Support team via support tickets.

You can open support tickets in the Neon Console. Look for the **Support** link in the sidebar. It opens the **Create Support Ticket** modal, where you can describe your issue. To access the modal directly, [click here](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

You can expect an initial response time of 2 business days, from 6am to 6pm Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8), Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays in the United States. For custom support solutions, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

## Priority support

Neon's [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) and [Business](/docs/introduction/plans#business) plans includes **Priority** support.

With Priority support, your support tickets are given priority by the Neon Support team and you can request a video chat. Requests for video chat should be submitted via a support ticket.

## Enterprise support

Neon's [Enterprise plan](/docs/introduction/plans#launch) includes **Enterprise** support.

With Enterprise support, you have everything offered with the Priority plan plus dedicated Customer Success Team support, and SLAs.

If you are a Launch, Scale, or Enterprise user and are unable to access the support ticket form in the Neon Console, you can use the following email address as a fallback: `support@neon.tech`
