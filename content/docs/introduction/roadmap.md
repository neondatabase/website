Our development teams are focused on helping you ship faster with Postgres. This roadmap describes committed features we're working on right now, what we delivered recently, and a peek at what's on the horizon.

## What we're working on now

Here's a snapshot of what we're working on now:

- **Data anonymization**: We're simplifying PII data anonymization to make Neon an ideal staging environment for your team's app development.
- **HIPAA compliance**: We are working toward HIPAA readiness, targeting completion by the end of Q2 2025. Learn more about Neon's compliance milestones on our [Compliance page](/docs/security/compliance).
- **More regions**: SÃ£o Paulo ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· is locked in for Q1 2025. Brazilian developers: we'd love to sponsor meetups and connect! Share your thoughts via the [Feedback form](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) in the Neon Console or our [Discord feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042). If you'd like support in other regions, please [submit a request](/docs/introduction/regions#request-a-region).
- **Improved migration assistance**: The [Neon Migration Assistant](/docs/import/migration-assistant) was introduced in Q4 2024. More improvements are coming in 2025 to make data import easier and faster.
- **Support for the [pg_search](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_search) extension**: This extension enables full text search over heap tables.
- **Scheduled updates**: We will be rolling out support for a scheduled updates feature in Neon to facilitate Postgres updates, security patches, and Neon feature enhancements. [Learn more](/docs/changelog/2025-01-24#scheduled-updates-comingSoon).
- **Backup & restore**: We'll start with scheduled snapshots with instant point-in-time recovery, eventually expanding this feature with more traditional automated backup capabilities.
- **Vercel preview deployment support**: We're adding support for preview deployments to our [Native Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel-native-integration).
- **Branch protection enhancements**: We're enhancing safeguards for [protected branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches) to strengthen their security and prevent accidental actions.
- **Neon on Azure GA**: We're working toward a GA release with deeper Azure integration.
- **Inbound logical replication GA**: Neon supports Postgres logical replication for inbound and outbound data. Outbound replication (replicating data from Neon) is GA. In 2025, inbound replication (replicating data to Neon) will also reach GA.
- **Neon serverless driver GA**: The [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) lets you connect to Neon from serverless environments over HTTP or WebSockets. We're fine-tuning its performance and preparing it for general availability (GA).

## What's on the horizon

And here's a quick list of what we'll be taking on in the near future:

- **Postgres for AI agents**: [Replit partnered with Neon to back Replit Agents](https://neon.tech/blog/looking-at-how-replit-agent-handles-databases), creating thousands of Postgres databases. If you're building AI agents and would like to integrate agent-ready Postgres, [connect with us](https://neon.tech/agent-design-partner). See [Postgres for AI Agents](https://neon.tech/use-cases/ai-agents) for more.
- **Exportable logs and traces**: We're exploring features to integrate Neon with monitoring platforms via Postgres log and trace exports.
- **Monitoring platform support**: After adding [Datadog integration](/docs/guides/datadog#steps-to-integrate-datadog-with-neon) in 2024, we're planning support for additional monitoring platforms.
- **Larger computes GA**: Autoscaling up to 16 vCPUs and fixed compute sizes up to 56 vCPUs are currently in Beta; GA support is planned for 2025.
- **Private Networking on Azure**: Following on [AWS PrivateLink support](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking), Azure Private Link is next.
- **Console navigation improvements**: Enhancing navigation for multi-project organizations, branch clarity, and better SQL Editor and Tables page interactions.
- **Private networking support on Azure**: We're planning to extend Neon's [Private Networking](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) feature to support Azure Private Link.

More projects supports use cases such as database-per-tenant and AI agents. [Read the announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/thousands-of-neon-projects-now-included-in-your-pricing-plan).
- **A new Postgres toolkit for AI agents and test environments**: We recently announced an experimental release of the [@neondatabase/toolkit](https://github.com/neondatabase/toolkit). This toolkit lets you spin up a Postgres database in seconds and run SQL queries. It includes both the [Neon API Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neondatabase/api-client) and the [Neon Serverless Driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless), making it an excellent choice for AI agents that need to quickly set up an SQL database, or for test environments where manually deploying a new database isn't practical. To learn more, see [Why we built @neondatabase/toolkit](https://neon.tech/blog/why-neondatabase-toolkit).
- **Postgres 17**: You can now run the very latest version of Postgres on Neon. [Read the announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/postgres-17).
- **SQL Editor AI features**: We added AI features to the Neon SQL Editor, including SQL generation, AI-generated query names, and an AI assistant that will fix your queries. [Learn more](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor#ai-features).
- **A new Business plan with more compute and storage**: This new plan provides higher storage and compute allowances (500 GB-month storage and 1,000 compute hours) in addition to all of Neon's advanced features. It also offers potential cost savings for customers requiring more storage than our Scale plan provides. To learn more, please refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page and [Plans](/docs/introduction/plans) documentation.
- **Data migration support with inbound logical replication**: We've introduced inbound logical replication as the first step toward enabling seamless, low-downtime migrations from your current database provider to Neon. This feature allows you to use Neon as your development environment, taking advantage of developer-friendly tools like branching and our [GitHub integration](/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), even if you keep production with your existing provider. To get started, explore our guides for replicating data from AlloyDB, Aurora, CloudSQL, and RDS. See [Replicate data to Neon](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide#replicate-data-to-neon). Inbound logical replication also supports migrating data between Neon projects, useful for version, region, or account migrations. See [Replicate data from one Neon project to another](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon-to-neon).
