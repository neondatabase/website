Our development teams are focused on helping you ship faster with Postgres. This roadmap describes committed features we're working on right now, what we delivered recently, and a peek at what's on the horizon.

## What we're working on now üõ†Ô∏è

Here's a snapshot of what we're working on now:

- **Postgres for AI agents**: [Replit partnered with Neon to back Replit Agents](/blog/looking-at-how-replit-agent-handles-databases), creating thousands of Postgres databases. If you're building AI agents and would like to integrate agent-ready Postgres, [connect with us](/agent-design-partner). See [Postgres for AI Agents](/use-cases/ai-agents) for more.
- **Snapshots**: Scheduled snapshots with instant restore.
- **Data API**: A Data API feature, powered by PostgREST.
- **Monitoring platform support**: After adding [Datadog integration](/docs/guides/datadog#steps-to-integrate-datadog-with-neon) in 2024, we're planning support for additional monitoring platforms.
- **Console navigation enhancements**: Enhancing navigation for multi-project organizations, branch clarity, and better SQL Editor and Tables page interactions.
- **Claimable Databases**: A new way for SaaS vendors to partner with Neon to offer instant Postgres databases. Let your users create Postgres databases ‚Äî no registration required.

It also offers potential cost savings for customers requiring more storage than our Scale plan provides. To learn more, please refer to our [Pricing](/pricing) page and [Plans](/docs/introduction/plans) documentation.
- **Data migration support with inbound logical replication**: We've introduced inbound logical replication as the first step toward enabling seamless, low-downtime migrations from your current database provider to Neon. This feature allows you to use Neon as your development environment, taking advantage of developer-friendly tools like branching and our [GitHub integration](/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), even if you keep production with your existing provider. To get started, explore our guides for replicating data from AlloyDB, Aurora, CloudSQL, and RDS. See [Replicate data to Neon](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide#replicate-data-to-neon). Inbound logical replication also supports migrating data between Neon projects, useful for version, region, or account migrations. See [Replicate data from one Neon project to another](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon-to-neon).
