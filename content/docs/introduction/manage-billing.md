A Neon account subscribed to a paid plan can manage billing from the **Billing** page in the Neon Console. On the **Billing** page, you can:

- View charges for the current month.
- Update your payment method
- View and download invoices
- Cancel a subscription

For Free Tier accounts, the **Billing** page allows users to view [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) usage limits, learn about [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) features, and estimate monthly Pro plan cost based on your current usage.

## View the billing page

To access your **Billing** page:

1. Navigate to the Neon Console.
1. Select **Billing** from the sidebar.

## Update your payment method

To update your payment method:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
2. Select the **Payment method** menu and click **Edit**.

## Invoices

A Neon invoice includes an **Amount due** for the billing period and a cost breakdown by [billing metric](/docs/introduction/billing).

### Download invoices

To download an invoice:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
1. Under **Latest invoices**, locate the invoice you want to download and click the PDF download icon.

## Cancel a subscription

To cancel a Pro plan subscription:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
1. Click **Request subscription cancellation** at the bottom of the page.
1. Follow the instructions on the **Request Downgrade** modal, and click **Downgrade**.

Canceling your Pro plan subscription downgrades your account to our Free Tier, which has lower usage limits that could affect the performance of your applications. To compare plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans#neon-plans).

You will be required to remove any projects, branches, or data that exceed [Free Tier limits](/docs/introduction/free-tier). The downgrade goes into effect within 30 minutes. You will receive your final bill at the beginning of the next billing period (the start of the month following the downgrade request).

For cancellation of Enterprise or Platform Partnership plans, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales). Cancellation of these plans is handled in accordance with the Master Subscription Agreement (MSA) outlined in the customer agreement.
