To stay informed about Neon's status, we provide a dedicated status page for each region that Neon supports. To view the Neon Status page, navigate to [https://neonstatus.com/](https://neonstatus.com/).

Remember to bookmark the Neon Status page for easy access.

For status information applicable to your Neon project, monitor the status page for the region where your Neon project resides. If you don't know the region, you can find it on the **Project Dashboard** in the Neon Console.

Status pages provide status for:

- Database Connectivity
- Database Operations
- Console and API Requests

<Admonition type="note" title="platform maintenance notices">
You can monitor or subscribe to your region's [status page](/docs/manage/platform-maintenance) to stay informed about upcoming platform maintenance. See [Subscribing to Neon status pages](#subscribing-to-neon-status-pages) below.

Neon also applies regular updates to your project's computes, but these updates are not posted to regional status pages since they are specific to your Neon project. To stay informed about these updates, watch for update notices in your project's settings in the Neon Console. See [Updates](/docs/manage/updates) for details.
