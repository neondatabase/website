Sign up for the **Early Access Program** and get:

- **Exclusive early access:** Get a first look at upcoming features before they go live.
- **Private community:** Gain access to a dedicated Discord channel to connect with the Neon team and provide feedback to help shape what comes next.
- **Weekly insights:** Receive updates on Neon's latest developments and future plans.

The Early Access Program is available at two levels, which you can enable independently:

## Personal Early Access

Enable Early Access for your personal account to preview new features. Early Access features under this program level will only apply to projects under your personal account.

[Sign up now](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to get started!

## Organization Early Access

Enable Early Access for your organization to preview new features. When an organization admin enables Early Access, everyone in your organization gets access to preview features across all projects belonging to that organization.

To enable Early Access for your organization, go to your organization **Settings** page in the Neon Console and **Join early access**.

## Opting Out

If you need to opt out of Early Access later, [contact our Support team](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support) about Early Access changes to ensure there's no disruption to features you may be using.
