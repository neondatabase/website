**Neon's Enterprise plan is customized to meet your needs**—whether that means custom pricing, expanded limits, dedicated service, or hands-on support. It includes all Neon features, priority support, and a direct access to our team of Postgres and platform engineers. Beyond that, we’ll work with you to define a plan that fits your workload and operational goals.

## Why Neon for Enterprise

Neon combines the power of Postgres with a modern serverless architecture to help you scale fast and ship confidently.

- **Serverless Postgres** – Instant autoscaling of CPU, memory, and connections
- **10,000+ concurrent connections** – Built-in connection pooling
- **Multi-TB Postgres workloads** — Support for enterprise workloads
- **Autoscaling** — Autoscaling of compute and storage for large workloads 
- **Database branching & instant provisioning** – Create production-grade environments on the fly
- **High availability and disaster recovery** – PITR, branching, and multi-AZ durability
- **Security and compliance** – HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA
- **Expert support** – Priority support and direct access to our team of Postgres engineers

## Who is the Enterprise plan for?

### Engineering teams at scale

Accelerate development workflows with branching, preview environments, and database automation. Move faster without managing Postgres infrastructure.

### Embedded Postgres

Offer Postgres to your users with built-in scalability, fast provisioning, and API-level control. Provision and manage thousands of databases with API-driven workflows. Use branching and autoscaling to reduce operational overhead and control costs. [Partner with Neon](https://neon.tech/partners)

### AI Agents

Spin up Postgres instances instantly for agent workloads, data processing, or long-lived sessions. Ideal for real-time inference and rapid prototyping. [Learn more](https://neon.tech/use-cases/ai-agents)

### Compliance-heavy SaaS

Companies with a strong security focus due to their industry
