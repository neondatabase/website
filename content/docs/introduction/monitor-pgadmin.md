pgAdmin is a database management tool for Postgres designed to facilitate various database tasks, including monitoring performance metrics.

![PgAdmin monitoring dashboard](/docs/introduction/pgadmin_monitor.png)

With pgAdmin, you can monitor real-time activity for a variety of metrics including:

- Active sessions (Total, Active, and Idle)
- Transactions per second (Transactions, Commits, Rollbacks)
- Tuples in (Inserts, Updates, Deletes)
- Tuples out (Fetched, Returned)
- Block I/O for shared buffers (see [Cache your data](/docs/postgresql/query-performance#cache-your-data) for information about Neon's Local File Cache)
- Database activity (Sessions, Locks, Prepared Transactions)

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
Neon currently does not support the `system_stats` extension required to use the **System Statistics** tab in pgAdmin. It's also important to note that pgAdmin, while active, polls your database for statistics, which does not allow your compute to suspend as it normally would when there is no other database activity.
