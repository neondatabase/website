Neon offers a _Custom_ plan option, which is a volume-based plan for medium and large-size teams, enterprises requiring database fleets, or SaaS vendors interested in reselling Neon or integrating serverless Postgres into their own service.

Our _Custom_ plan can be tailored to your specific requirements with:

- A custom contract
- Volume-based discounts
- Prepaid or integrated billing
- Access to all Neon features available with the [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan)
- Tailored features and solutions
- Custom support options
