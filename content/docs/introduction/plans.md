Neon's plans are designed to meet different user requirements, ranging from hobby projects to enterprise-level production workloads. We also offer custom enterprise plans with volume-based discounts for large teams or database fleets. Refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page for fees and a detailed plan comparison.

Neon offers four plans:

- [Free Plan](#free-plan)
- [Launch](#launch)
- [Scale](#scale)
- [Business](#business)
- [Enterprise](#enterprise)

<Admonition type="tip" title="Plan Allowances and Extra Usage">
Neon plans are structured around **Allowances** and **Extra usage**. Allowances are included in your plan. With Neon's paid plans, you can purchase [extra usage](/docs/introduction/extra-usage) in set increments for when you need to go over your allowance.

## Free Plan

Neon's Free Plan plan is best for hobby projects, prototypes, and learning Neon.

### Free Plan allowances

The Free Plan includes the following usage allowances:

| Usage type                 | Plan allowance                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Projects**               | 10 Neon projects                                                                                                                                         |
| **Branches**               | 10 branches per project                                                                                                                                  |
| **Databases**              | 500 per branch                                                                                                                                           |
| **Storage**                | 0.5 GB-month (regular and archive storage combined)                                                                                                      |
| **Compute**                | 191.9 compute hours/month&#8212;enough to run a primary 0.25 CU compute 24/7; up to 5 of those compute hours can be used for non-default branch computes |
| **Data transfer (Egress)** | 5 GB per month                                                                                                                                           |

<Admonition type="tip" title="What is a compute hour?">

- A **compute hour** is one _active hour_ for a compute with 1 vCPU. For a compute with .25 vCPU, it takes 4 _active hours_ to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if your compute has 4 vCPUs, it takes only 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour.
- An **active hour** is a measure of the amount of time a compute is active. The time your compute is idle when suspended due to inactivity is not counted.
- **Compute hours formula**

  ```
  compute hours = compute size * active hours
  ```

</Admonition>

### Free Plan features

- Autoscaling up to 2 vCPU
- Scale to zero
- Monitoring with 1 day of historical data
- All supported regions
- Project collaboration
- Advanced Postgres features such as connection pooling, logical replication, and 60+ Postgres extensions
- Neon features such as branching, point-in-time restore up to **24 hours** in the past, time travel connections, and more
- [Community support](/docs/introduction/support)

For a complete list of features, refer to the **detailed plan comparison** on the [Neon pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Free Plan Compute Allowances">
On the Free Plan, you have 191.9 compute hours/month&#8212;enough to run a primary 0.25 CU compute 24/7. Up to 5 of those compute hours can be used for non-default branch computes. Autoscaling up to 2 vCPU with 8 GB RAM is available for extra performance during peak times, but please be aware that autoscaling can consume your compute hours more quickly, potentially impacting the ability to run a primary 0.25 CU compute 24/7. If you use Autoscaling or Read Replicas, you'll need to monitor your compute hours to ensure you don't run out before the end of the month.

If you go over the 5 compute hour allowance for non-default branch computes, those computes are suspended until the allowance resets at the beginning of the month. If you go over the 191.9 compute hour allowance, all computes are suspended until the beginning of the month.
</Admonition>
