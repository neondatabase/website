subtitle: Get familiar with Neon billing using our pricing calculators
---

If you already have a sense of your sizing and usage needs, we recommend that you try out the [Pricing Calculator](#pricing-calculator) on our website or our [Pro Plan Cost Estimator](#pro-plan-cost-estimator) in the Neon Console. The tools let you estimate monthly costs based on the billing metrics above.

## Things to consider before using

With autoscaling as the key to our pay-for-use model, you will ideally have some sense of what kind of usage your application requires before you try out our calculators. A few questions for you to consider:
* _How active are your users_?
* _What level of performance does your applciation require_?
* _How much storage do you require_?

These questions translate into the metrics [active time](/docs/introduction/billing#active-time), [compute size](docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration), and [storage space](/docs/introduction/billing#project-storage).

## Pricing calculator

The [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page on the Neon website provides a [calculator](https://neon.tech/pricing#calc) that allows you to estimate monthly costs based on usage amounts that you provide.

## Pro Plan Cost Estimator

The **Billing** page in the Neon Console provides a **Pro Plan Cost Estimator** tool, which estimates costs based on your current project usage. If you have ever wondered, "How much would my monthly cost be if I upgraded to the Neon Pro Plan?", this tool provides the answer. To access it, navigate to the **Billing** page via the sidebar of the Neon Console, and select **Open Cost Estimator**.

To provide cost estimates, the **Pro Plan Cost Estimator** requires at least one month of project usage.
