## Converting billing from Neon to AWS

Converting billing for a Neon Organization account from Neon to AWS requires the following:

1. Setting up a new AWS subscription. Be sure to note the following details:

   - Your **AWS Account ID**
   - The **Agreement ID** for the new subscription.

2. Opening [Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support) ticket with these details:

   - Your AWS Account ID.
   - The Agreement ID for the new subscription.
