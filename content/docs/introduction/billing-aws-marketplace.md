Neon supports billing through the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fgeh3a7yeuzh6?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) for [Private Offers](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/partners/private-offers/) only, which are typically reserved for custom Enterprise plans. If you are interested in exploring a custom Enterprise plan with Neon, please reach out to our [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) team.

Neon [self-service pricing plans](https://neon.tech/pricing) are currently not purchasable through the AWS Marketplace. You can only purchase these plans through Neon.

If you have any questions about billing in general or require assistance, please reach out to [Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).
