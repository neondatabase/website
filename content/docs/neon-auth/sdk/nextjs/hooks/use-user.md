This standalone React hook is an alias for `useStackApp().useUser()`. It only exists for convenience; it does not have any additional functionality.

For more information, see the [documentation for `stackClientApp.useUser()`](/docs/neon-auth/sdk/nextjs/objects/stack-app#stackclientappuseuseroptions).
