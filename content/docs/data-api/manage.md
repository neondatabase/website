Once the Data API is enabled, you can customize its behavior, manage how it authenticates users, or disable it entirely if it is no longer needed.

## Advanced settings

Navigate to the **Data API** section in your project sidebar and look for the **Configuration** panel. These settings control the security and limits of your HTTP endpoint.

![Data API advanced settings](/docs/data-api/data_api_advanced_settings.png)

### Exposed schemas

**Default:** `public`

Defines which PostgreSQL schemas are exposed as REST API endpoints. By default, only the `public` schema is accessible. If you use other schemas (e.g., `api`, `v1`), add them here as a comma-separated list.

<Admonition type="note">
**Permissions apply:** Adding a schema here exposes the *endpoints*, but the database role used by the API must still have `USAGE` privileges on the schema and `SELECT` privileges on the tables. Refer to [Access control for Data API](/docs/data-api/access-control) for more details.
</Admonition>

### Anonymous role

**Default:** `anonymous`

Specifies the database role used for **unauthenticated requests** (requests sent without an Authorization header). To allow public access to specific data, configure this role in your database using SQL `GRANT` statements.

### Maximum rows per request

**Default:** `1000`

Enforces a hard limit on the number of rows returned in a single API response. This prevents accidental performance degradation from large queries. Clients should use pagination limits to retrieve data within this threshold. This also prevents unexpected egress costs from large data transfers.

### CORS allowed origins

**Default:** Empty (Allows all origins)

Controls which web domains are permitted to fetch data from your API via the browser.

- **Empty:** Allows `*` (any domain). Useful for development.
- **Production:** List your specific domains (e.g., `https://myapp.com`) to prevent unauthorized websites from querying your API.

## Authentication providers

The Data API uses **JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)** to validate the JWT tokens sent by your clients. You can manage trusted providers in the **Authentication providers** section.

### Neon Auth (Default)

When you enable the Data API with Neon Auth, your project's unique JWKS URL is automatically configured. This allows the API to trust tokens generated by Neon's authentication system.

### Manage providers

You can add, replace, or remove authentication providers. Note that only one provider can be configured at a time.

- **Add a provider:** If no provider is currently configured, click **Set up authentication provider** and enter the JWKS URL supplied by your auth service (e.g., Auth0, Clerk, or Firebase). Some providers also require a [JWT Audience](/docs/data-api/custom-authentication-providers#what-is-jwt-audience) value.
- **Replace a provider:** To switch to a different provider, remove the current one first, then add the new one.
- **Remove a provider:** Click the optional menu (**...**) on the provider card and select **Remove provider**.

<Admonition type="warning">
**Impact of removal:** Removing an authentication provider invalidates all tokens issued by that provider. Users relying on that provider will receive `401 Unauthorized` errors until they authenticate via a valid provider.

## Disable the Data API

If you no longer need HTTP access to your database, you can disable the API entirely.

Scroll to the **Disable** section at the bottom of the Configuration page and click the **Disable** button.

![Disable Data API section](/docs/data-api/disable.png)

<Admonition type="danger" title="Immediate Effect">
Disabling the Data API **immediately terminates** all active connections and blocks all incoming HTTP requests. Any applications, edge functions, or websites relying on the API will stop working instantly.
