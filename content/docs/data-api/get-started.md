The Neon Data API, powered by [PostgREST](https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v13/), offers a ready-to-use REST API for your Neon database. You can interact with any table, view, or function using standard HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`). To simplify querying, use client libraries like [`postgrest-js`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js), [`postgrest-py`](https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-py), or [`postgrest-go`](https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-go):

```javascript shouldWrap
const { data } = await client.from('posts').select('*');
```

<Admonition type="info" title="About RLS and Neon RLS">
When using the Data API, it is essential to set up RLS policies so that you can safely expose your databases to clients such as web apps. Make sure that all of your tables have RLS policies, and that you have carefully reviewed each policy.

You might notice another feature in Neon called **Neon RLS**. Please be aware that it's a different method for client-side querying and **is not compatible with the Data API**. We recommend using the Data API for client-side querying as it provides a more secure and controlled way to access your data through predefined REST endpoints.

<Steps>

## Enable the Data API

Enable the Data API at the **branch** level for a single database.

To get started, open the **Data API** page from the project sidebar and click **Enable**.

![Data API page with enable button](/docs/data-api/data_api_sidebar.png)

Enabling the Data API on your branch gives you:

- A **REST API endpoint** for your branch (your base URL for API requests) with a copy-to-clipboard control
- **Neon Auth** as your default authentication provider (if you accept the default)
- Two Postgres roles:
  - **`authenticated`** – used when a request includes a valid JWT
  - **`anonymous`** – will be used for unauthenticated requests (coming soon)

![Data API enabled view with REST API Endpoint](/docs/data-api/data-api-enabled.png)

You can change the provider to **Other provider** if you want to manage your own JWTs, or skip authentication setup and add it later. But if you accept the default, Neon Auth is ready to use immediately. If you select **Other provider**, you'll need to provide your provider's JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) URL to validate JWT tokens.

_Always secure your data before using the Data API in production._

## Secure your Data API

To secure your Data API you must configure both of the following:

- **GRANT statements** that define which operations (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) each role can attempt
- **Row-Level Security (RLS) policies** that control which specific rows each role can see or modify

### GRANT permissions

```sql
-- For existing tables
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON ALL TABLES
  IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

-- For future tables
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
  GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON TABLES TO authenticated;

-- For sequences (for identity columns)
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

-- Schema usage
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="Authentication required">
**All requests to the Data API currently require authentication** with a valid JWT token. Anonymous access is not supported yet, but is coming soon. In the near future, we'll provide public/long-lived tokens for anonymous users.
</Admonition>

### Create a table with RLS

Here's a sample `posts` table secured with RLS. The GRANT statements above give authenticated users access to all tables, which allows the Data API to work. RLS policies then control which specific rows each user can see and modify.

For guidance on writing RLS policies, see our [PostgreSQL RLS tutorial](/postgresql/postgresql-administration/postgresql-row-level-security) for the basics, or our recommended [Drizzle RLS guide](/docs/guides/rls-drizzle) for a simpler approach.

<CodeTabs labels={["SQL", "Drizzle (crudPolicy)", "Drizzle (pgPolicy)"]}>

```sql shouldWrap
CREATE TABLE "posts" (
	"id" bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
	"userId" text DEFAULT (auth.user_id()) NOT NULL,
	"content" text NOT NULL,
	"published" boolean DEFAULT false NOT NULL
);

-- Enable RLS and create policies
ALTER TABLE "posts" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- When RLS is enabled, all operations are denied by default unless explicitly allowed by policies.

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read any post" ON "posts"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT TO "authenticated"
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert their own posts" ON "posts"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT TO "authenticated"
WITH CHECK ((select auth.user_id() = "userId"));

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update their own posts" ON "posts"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR UPDATE TO "authenticated"
USING ((select auth.user_id() = "userId"))
WITH CHECK ((select auth.user_id() = "userId"));

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete their own posts" ON "posts"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR DELETE TO "authenticated"
USING ((select auth.user_id() = "userId"));
```

```typescript
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { crudPolicy, authenticatedRole, authUid } from 'drizzle-orm/neon';
import { bigint, boolean, pgTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const posts = pgTable(
  'posts',
  {
    id: bigint({ mode: 'number' }).primaryKey(),
    userId: text()
      .notNull()
      .default(sql`(auth.user_id())`),
    content: text().notNull(),
    published: boolean().notNull().default(false),
  },
  (table) => [
    // Policy for authenticated users
    crudPolicy({
      role: authenticatedRole,
      read: true, // Can also read all posts
      modify: authUid(table.userId), // Can only modify their own posts
    }),
  ]
);
```

```typescript
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { authenticatedRole, authUid } from 'drizzle-orm/neon';
import { bigint, boolean, pgPolicy, pgTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const posts = pgTable(
  'posts',
  {
    id: bigint({ mode: 'number' }).primaryKey(),
    userId: text()
      .notNull()
      .default(sql`(auth.user_id())`),
    content: text().notNull(),
    published: boolean().notNull().default(false),
  },
  (table) => [
    // Authenticated users
    pgPolicy('Allow authenticated users to read any post', {
      to: authenticatedRole,
      for: 'select',
      using: sql`true`,
    }),
    pgPolicy('Allow authenticated users to insert their own posts', {
      to: authenticatedRole,
      for: 'insert',
      withCheck: authUid(table.userId),
    }),
    pgPolicy('Allow authenticated users to update their own posts', {
      to: authenticatedRole,
      for: 'update',
      using: authUid(table.userId),
      withCheck: authUid(table.userId),
    }),
    pgPolicy('Allow authenticated users to delete their own posts', {
      to: authenticatedRole,
      for: 'delete',
      using: authUid(table.userId),
    }),
  ]
);
```

</CodeTabs>

The `auth.user_id()` function is provided by the Data API and extracts the user ID from JWT tokens, making it available to your RLS policies for enforcing per-user access control.

With the `posts` table and its RLS policies in place, you can now securely query and modify posts using the Data API.

## Query from your app

The Neon Auth SDK (Stack Auth) manages JWT tokens automatically. Here's an example showing how to use it with `postgrest-js`:

```ts shouldWrap
import { PostgrestClient } from '@supabase/postgrest-js';
import { useUser } from '@stackframe/stack';

// Example: fetch notes for the current user
async function fetchUserNotes() {
  const user = useUser(); // [!code highlight]
  if (!user) return null;

  const { accessToken } = await user.getAuthJson(); // [!code highlight]
  const pg = new PostgrestClient(import.meta.env.VITE_DATA_API_URL, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` }, // [!code highlight]
  });

  const { data, error } = await pg
    .from('notes')
    .select('id, title, created_at, owner_id, shared')
    .eq('owner_id', user.id) // [!code highlight]
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false }); // [!code highlight]

  return { data, error };
}
```

This example shows the key steps:

1. Get the current user with `useUser()`
2. Extract their JWT token with `user.getAuthJson()`
3. Create a PostgrestClient with proper authentication headers
4. Query the Data API with filtering (`.eq('owner_id', user.id)`) and ordering (`.order('created_at', { ascending: false })`)

## Refresh schema cache

When you modify your database schema (adding tables, columns, or changing structure), the Data API needs to refresh its cache.

- Console: go to **Data API** section and click **Refresh schema cache**
- SQL: run `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`

</Steps>
