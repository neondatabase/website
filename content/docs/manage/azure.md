<PublicPreview/>

[Neon is available on the Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/neon1722366567200.neon_serverless_postgres_azure_prod?tab=Overview) as an [Azure Native ISV Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/partners), allowing you to work with Neon the same way you work with other native solutions from Microsoft. Billing is handled directly through Azure, and you can choose from Neon pricing plans when deploying the service.

## Key benefits

Deploying Neon natively on Azure lets you manage your Neon organization alongside the rest of your Azure infrastructure. Key benefits include:

- **Azure-native management**: Provision and manage Neon organizations directly from the Azure portal.
- **Single sign-on (SSO)**: Access Neon using your Azure credentialsâ€”no separate logins required.
- **Consolidated billing**: Simplify cost management with unified billing through the Azure Marketplace.
- **Integrated workflows**: Use the Azure CLI and SDKs to manage Neon as part of your regular workflows, integrated with your existing Azure resources.

    <Admonition type="note">
    Management of Neon projects, databases, and branches is supported through the Neon Console, CLI, and API. However, this public preview lays the groundwork for further deeper between Neon and Azure, including integration with other Azure native services.
