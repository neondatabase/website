If a former employee owned a Neon account and didn’t shut it down or transfer access before leaving, you can follow the steps outlined below to recover the account.

<Steps>

## Regain access through the original login method

First, determine how the account was accessed.

### A. If the account used a third-party login

If the former employee signed up with a third-party identity provider (e.g., Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Hasura), you must recover access to that account through your organization's identity provider. Neon cannot bypass third-party authentication.

### B. If the account used email and password

If you have access to the former employee's company email account:

1. Go to the [Neon login page](https://console.neon.tech/login)
2. Click **Forgot Password**
3. Enter the former employee's email address
4. Access the password reset link from their inbox
5. Set a new password and sign in

Once signed in, you can:

- [Update the email address](/docs/manage/accounts#update-personal-information)
- [Transfer project ownership](/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer)
- [Add an admin](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#set-permissions) to your projects or organization
- [Update billing details](/docs/introduction/manage-billing)

<Admonition type="note">
For security reasons, we recommend immediately revoking access to company email accounts when employees leave your organization.
</Admonition>

## If you cannot access the email or login method

If the original login method is inaccessible, we can assist through a manual identity verification process.

To begin:

1. Open a [Neon Support ticket](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support) from your Neon account.
2. Provide:
   - A signed statement on company letterhead explaining the situation
   - Contact details for another employee at your company

Neon will:

- Notify the email address associated with the account and wait 24 business hours (Mon–Fri) for a response
- Send you a document to sign electronically
- Schedule a short video call to verify your identity (please have a government-issued ID ready)

<Admonition type="info">
Neon will not store or copy your ID. It's used only to confirm that the person on the call is who they say they are.
</Admonition>

Once all steps are complete, we'll grant access to the account or transfer project ownership as needed.

<Admonition type="important">
Neon Support may request additional information during or after the verification process. Manual account recovery is a sensitive procedure designed to protect your organization's data and prevent unauthorized access.
