Most actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). You'll need an API key to validate your requests. Each key is a randomly-generated 64-bit token that you must include when calling Neon API methods. All keys remain valid until deliberately revoked.

## Types of API keys

Neon supports three types of API keys:

| Key Type               | Who Can Create              | Scope                                                                          | Validity                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Personal API Key       | Any user                    | User's personal projects and any organization projects where they are a member | Valid until revoked; org project access ends if user leaves organization |
| Organization API Key   | Organization administrators | All projects within the organization                                           | Valid until revoked                                                      |
| Project-scoped API Key | Any organization member     | Single specified project                                                       | Valid until revoked or project leaves organization                       |

While there is no strict limit on the number of API keys you can create, we recommend keeping it under 10,000 per Neon account.

## Creating API keys

You'll need to create your first API key from the Neon Console, where you are already authenticated. You can then use that key to generate new keys from the API.

<Admonition type="note">
When creating API keys from the Neon Console, the secret token will be displayed only once. Copy it immediately and store it securely in a credential manager (like AWS Key Management Service or Azure Key Vault) — you won't be able to retrieve it later. If you lose an API key, you'll need to revoke it and create a new one.
</Admonition>

### Create a personal API key

You can create a personal API key in the Neon Console or using the Neon API.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
In the Neon Console, select **Account settings** > **API keys**. You'll see a list of any existing keys, along with the button to create a new key.

![Creating a personal API key in the Neon Console](/docs/manage/personal_api_key.png)
</TabItem>

<TabItem>
You'll need an existing personal key (create one from the Neon Console) in order to create new keys using the API. If you've got a key ready, you can use the following request to generate new keys:

```bash shouldWrap
curl https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/api_keys
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERSONAL_API_KEY"
  -d '{"key_name": "my-key"}'
```

**Parameters:**

- `key_name`: A descriptive name for the API key (e.g., "development", "staging", "ci-pipeline")

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 177630,
  "key": "neon_api_key_1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
}
```

To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createapikey).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create an organization API key

Organization API keys provide admin-level access to all organization resources. Only organization admins can create these keys. To create an organization API key, you must use your personal API key and be an administrator in the organization. Neon will verify your admin status before allowing the key creation.

For more detail about organization-related methods, see [Organization API Keys](/docs/manage/orgs-api#api-keys).

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

Navigate to your organization's **Settings** > **API keys** to view a list of existing keys and the button to create a new key.

![creating an api key from the console](/docs/manage/org_api_keys.png)
</TabItem>

<TabItem>

To create an organization API key via the API, you need to use your personal API key. You also need to have admin-level permissions in the specified organization.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/organizations/{org_id}/api_keys' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer $PERSONAL_API_KEY' \
     --data '{"key_name": "orgkey"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 165434,
  "key": "neon_org_key_1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
  "name": "orgkey",
  "created_at": "2022-11-15T20:13:35Z",
  "created_by": "user_01h84bfr2npa81rn8h8jzz8mx4"
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Create project-scoped organization API keys

Project-scoped API keys have [member-level access](/docs/manage/organizations#user-roles-and-permissions), meaning they **cannot** delete the project they are associated with. These keys:

- Can only access and manage the specified project
- Cannot perform organization-related actions or create new projects
- Will stop working if the project is transferred out of the organization

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
In your organization's **Settings** > **API keys**, click **Create new** and select **Project-scoped** to create a key for your chosen project.

![Project-scoped API keys from the Console](/docs/manage/project_scoped_select.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
Any organization member can create an API key for any organization-owned project using the following command:

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/organizations/{org_id}/api_keys' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer $PERSONAL_API_KEY' \
     --data '{"key_name":"only-this-project", "project_id": "some-project-123"}'
```

**Parameters:**

- `org_id`: The ID of your organization
- `key_name`: A descriptive name for the API key
- `project_id`: The ID of the project to which the API key will be scoped

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1904821,
  "key": "neon_project_key_1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
  "name": "test-project-scope",
  "created_at": "2024-12-11T21:34:58Z",
  "created_by": "user_01h84bfr2npa81rn8h8jzz8mx4",
  "project_id": "project-id-123"
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Make an API call

The following example demonstrates how to use your API key to retrieve projects:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

where:

- `"https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects"` is the resource URL, which includes the base URL for the Neon API and the `/projects` endpoint.
- The `"Accept: application/json"` in the header specifies the accepted response type.
- The `Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY` entry in the header specifies your API key. Replace `$NEON_API_KEY` with an actual 64-bit API key. A request without this header, or containing an invalid or revoked API key, fails and returns a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status code.
- [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is an optional third-party tool that formats the JSON response, making it easier to read.

## List API keys

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
Navigate to **Account settings** > **API keys** to view your personal API keys, or your organization's **Settings** > **API keys** to view organization API keys.
</TabItem>

<TabItem>

For personal API keys:

```bash shouldWrap
curl "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/api_keys" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
 -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

For organization API keys:

```bash shouldWrap
curl "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/organizations/{org_id}/api_keys" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
 -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Revoke API Keys

You should revoke API keys that are no longer needed or if you suspect a key may have been compromised. Key details:

- The action is immediate and permanent
- All API requests using the revoked key will fail with a 401 Unauthorized error
- The key cannot be reactivated — you'll need to create a new key if access is needed again

### Who can revoke keys

- Personal API keys can only be revoked by the account owner
- Organization API keys can be revoked by organization admins
- Project-scoped keys can be revoked by organization admins

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
In the Neon Console, navigate to **Account settings** > **API keys** and click **Revoke** next to the key you want to revoke. The key will be immediately revoked. Any request that uses this key will now fail.

![Revoking an API key in the Neon Console](/docs/manage/revoke_api_key.png)
</TabItem>

<TabItem>
The following Neon API method revokes the specified API key. The `key_id` is a required parameter:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/api_keys/177630' \
  -H "Accept: application/json"  \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```
