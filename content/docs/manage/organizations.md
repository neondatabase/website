Build your team in Neon with Organizations. Manage all of your team's projects under a single account — with billing, role management, and project collaboration capabilities in one accessible location.

## About Neon Organizations

In the Neon Console, the Organizations page provides a centralized view of all your team's projects. From there, you can create new projects, manage existing ones, as well as oversee your organization's members and your billing information.

## User roles and permissions

Each organization is made up of three types of users:

- **Admin** — Administrators have access to all projects in the organization. Additionally, admins manage all permissions, invitations, and billing details.
- **Members** — Members have access to all the projects that belong to the organization. They need to be invited to the organization by an Admin.
- **Collaborators** — Collaborators are people given limited access to particular projects. See [Collaborators](/docs/guides/project-collaboration-guide). They do not have access to the Organization dashboard. Projects will appear under the **Shared with you** grouping in their personal account.

Here's a breakdown of what actions each role can take:

| Action                                                                                 | Admin | Member | Collaborator |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :----: | :----------: |

| [Transfer projects](/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer)\*                              |  ✅   |   ✅   |      ❌      |

| [Set permissions](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#set-permissions)                            |  ✅   |   ❌   |      ❌      |
| [Manage billing](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#billing)                                     |  ✅   |   ❌   |      ❌      |
| [Delete organization](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#delete-an-organization)                 |  ✅   |   ❌   |      ❌      |

\* Some restrictions apply. See the [Transfer projects to an organization](/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer) for details.

## Create an organization

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'top' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '0 0 45%', paddingRight: '20px' }}>
    To get started, click **Create organization** from the breadcrumb dropdown.
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: '0 0 55%', marginTop: '-20px' }}>
    ![create organization button](/docs/manage/orgs_create_button.png)
  </div>
</div>

### Free Plan

If you're on the Free Plan, you'll need to choose a paid plan for your organization (since organizations are a paid feature).

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'top' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '0 0 45%', paddingRight: '20px' }}>
    You'll be prompted to select a plan and enter billing details. After confirming, you'll be directed to your organization's billing page, where you can invite [members](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#invite-members) and [transfer projects](/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer).
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: '0 0 55%', marginTop: '-20px' }}>
  ![convert personal account to an organization](/docs/manage/orgs_create_with_billing.png)
  </div>
</div>

### Paid plans

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'top' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '0 0 45%', paddingRight: '20px' }}>
    If you're already on a paid plan for your personal account, you'll have two options:
    - Convert your personal account to an organization
    - Create a new organization from scratch
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: '0 0 55%', marginTop: '-20px' }}>
    ![convert personal account to an organization](/docs/manage/orgs_create_with_transfer.png)
  </div>
</div>

#### Convert your personal account

Converting your personal account transfers all of your projects and billing to the new organization. Your personal account will switch to the Free Plan. This is a quick, one-time, one-way operation: everything in your personal account is transferred to your new organization instantly. There is no service disruption, no change to your connections, and no way to move resources back to your personal account after the conversion.

After conversion, you can:

- [Invite](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#invite-members) team members to collaborate on transferred projects
- Promote collaborators to organization members (their project-specific collaborator permissions will be replaced with full organization access)
- Delegate billing to another team member by setting their [permissions](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#set-permissions) to **Admin**

#### Create a new organization

If you create a new organization, you can choose which projects (if any) to [transfer](/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer). You'll need to select a paid plan for the organization. Your personal account will remain on its current paid plan, so you'll be billed for both accounts.

After creating the organization, you can:

- [Invite](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#invite-members) team members to the new organization
- Delegate billing to another team member by setting their [permissions](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#set-permissions) to **Admin**
- [Create new projects](/docs/manage/orgs-manage#create-and-delete-projects) within the organization

<Admonition type="note">
Project transfers to an organization are one-way. You cannot move organization projects back to your personal account.

## Limitations

As we continue to refine our organization features, here are some temporary limitations you should be aware of:

- **Branch management** — All users are currently able to manage [protected branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches), regardless of their role or permission level. Granular permissions for this feature are not yet implemented.
- **Permissions and roles** — The current permissions system may not meet all needs for granular control. Users are encouraged to share their feedback and requirements for more detailed permissions settings.
