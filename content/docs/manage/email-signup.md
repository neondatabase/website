As you get more familiar with Neon, you may decide to bring Neon into your organization, or change the type of account you want to associate with Neon. This page covers the kinds of email-related changes that you might encounter as you mature your usage with Neon.

## Signing in to a social account with your email

If you already have a Neon account using one of our social or partner login options but you now want to sign in with your email account, all you have to do is add a password to your profile.

Go to **Profile** and click **Update Password**.

<Admonition type="note">
If you don't see an **Update Password** button, please sign out and sign back in. You should then see the option. This is a legacy issue; it will be resolved soon.
</Admonition>

You will be guided through a few steps, asking you to reauthenticate using your original social account, and then create your new password. After that, you are free to sign into your Neon account using either your social account or the email option.

## Changing your email

If you've signed up with a social or partner login and now want to change your email &#8212; for example, you previously signed up using a Google, GitHub, Microsoft, or Hasura account and now want to use your personal email &#8212; you can make this change under **Profile → Account Settings → Personal Information**.

Or follow this direct link:

[change email](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/profile?modal=change_email)

After you make the change, you'll receive a notification at this new email address asking you to confirm. Once confirmed, you'll be logged out of Neon. Log back in with your new email, and use this email going forward.

<Admonition type="note">
If your email address is greyed-out and you can't update it, try logging out and then logging back into the console.
</Admonition>

## Removing email as a login method

Removing an email account as a login method is currently not supported via the Neon Console. If you need to remove this login method in favor of a Google or GitHub social account login, please contact [Support](/docs/introduction/support) for assistance. If you are looking to remove your Neon account entirely, see [Delete your account](/docs/introduction/manage-billing#delete-your-account) for instructions.
