With Neon's API, your agents can:

- Provision PostgreSQL databases in ~500ms
- Add production-ready authentication
- Create database snapshots for version control
- Implement per-user resource limits and usage tracking
- Scale databases to zero when idle (no compute charges when idle; storage is still billed)

Architecture assumption: This guide uses one Neon project per user for better isolation and security. For detailed architecture patterns and billing models, see the [platform integration getting started guide](/docs/guides/platform-integration-get-started).

## API Operations

## Quick start with the demo

See the pattern in action with a working snapshot database versioning demo.

- Repo: https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/snapshots-as-checkpoints-demo
- Live demo: https://snapshots-as-checkpoints-demo.vercel.app/

Demo architecture: meta database (users via Neon Auth, `projects`, `checkpoints`) + per-user app database (one Neon project per user session, URL saved in `projects`).

## Key concepts

- **Root branches** (like `main`): The only branches that can be snapshotted
- **Connection string stability**: Achieved through a restore with `finalize_restore: true`
- **Operation polling**: Required after a restore with `finalize_restore: true` to ensure compute endpoint transfer completes
- **Orphaned branches**: Created during restore (such as "main (old)"), delete to avoid extra costs
- **Scale-to-zero**: Databases suspend when idle, wake in under 500ms on next query

Neon's copy-on-write storage enables version-aware backends. Use snapshots, branching, and point-in-time recovery to support undo, checkpoints, and safe experimentation.

## Application provisioning

Your agent provisions databases for each user's applications. The infrastructure is created quickly (under 500ms) and cost-effectively, as databases scale to zero when idle - you only pay when databases are active or storing data.

### Create project with database

The `default_endpoint_settings` in the project creation request automatically configures the compute endpoint with your desired autoscaling and suspension settings.

#### Neon toolkit example

This example uses the neon [@neondatabase/toolkit](/docs/reference/neondatabase-toolkit), while other examples use generic cURL commands. Use the driver of your choice.

```ts
import { NeonToolkit } from '@neondatabase/toolkit';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

async function testNeonApi() {
  try {
    const toolkit = new NeonToolkit(process.env.NEON_API_KEY!);
    const tenantId = 'example-tenant';

    console.log('Starting Neon API test...');
    console.log(`Tenant ID: ${tenantId}`);

    // 1) Create a project with main branch, role, and database
    console.log('Creating project...');
    const project = await toolkit.createProject({
      name: `agent-${tenantId}-prod`,
      branch: { name: 'main', role_name: 'app_user', database_name: 'app_db' },
      default_endpoint_settings: {
        autoscaling_limit_min_cu: 0.25,
        autoscaling_limit_max_cu: 1,
        suspend_timeout_seconds: 300,
      },
      pg_version: 17,
      region_id: 'aws-us-east-2',
    });

    const projectId = project.project.id;
    const endpointId = project.endpoints[0].id;
    const branchId = project.branches.id;

    console.log('Project created successfully!');
    console.log(`Project ID: ${projectId}`);
    console.log(`Endpoint ID: ${endpointId}`);
    console.log(`Branch ID: ${branchId}`);

    // 2) Optional: set quotas (match your free/pro tiers)
    console.log('Setting quotas...');
    await toolkit.apiClient.updateProject(projectId, {
      project: {
        settings: {
          quota: {
            logical_size_bytes: 100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100 MiB in bytes
            active_time_seconds: 633600,
            compute_time_seconds: 158400,
          },
        },
      },
    });

    console.log('Quotas set successfully!');

    // 3) Get the pooled connection string
    console.log('ðŸ”— Retrieving pooled connection string...');
    const connectionUri = await toolkit.apiClient.getConnectionUri({
      projectId: projectId,
      branch_id: branchId,
      database_name: 'app_db',
      role_name: 'app_user',
      pooled: true,
    });

    console.log('Pooled connection retrieved!');
    console.log(`Pooled Connection URI: ${connectionUri.data.uri}`);
    console.log('Test completed successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error occurred:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

testNeonApi();
```

#### Create development branches

For development work (separate from production versioning), create regular branches with their own connection strings:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834/branches" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "branch": {
      "parent_id": "br-aged-salad-637688",
      "name": "feature-new-ui"
    },
    "endpoints": [{
      "type": "read_write",
      "autoscaling_limit_min_cu": 0.25,
      "autoscaling_limit_max_cu": 0.5
    }]
  }'
```

> Each branch gets a new connection string. Use snapshots for production versioning to preserve connection strings during a restore with `finalize_restore: true`.

## Resource management

Track usage per project with detailed information about compute time, storage, and network I/O. Enforce quotas via the API to match your defined plans, giving you full control over how resources are consumed.

### Set project resource limits

Define limits based on user tier, for example:

| Tier | Storage (MiB) | Compute Time (s) | Active Time (s) |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Free | 100           | 158,400          | 633,600         |
| Pro  | 10000         | 10,368,000       | 2,592,000       |

This example sets the free tier limit defined above:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project": {
      "quota": {
        "logical_size_mib": 100,
        "active_time_seconds": 633600,
        "compute_time_seconds": 158400
      }
    }
  }'
```

For additional information, see the [configure consumption limits](/docs/guides/consumption-limits) guide.

### Get project consumption

```bash
curl -X GET "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834/consumption" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "project_id": "shiny-wind-028834",
  "period_start": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "period_end": "2024-01-31T23:59:59Z",
  "compute_time_seconds": 158400,
  "active_time_seconds": 633600,
  "data_storage_bytes_hour": 1073741824,
  "data_transfer_bytes": 5368709120,
  "written_data_bytes": 2147483648
}
```

For additional information, see the [querying consumption metrics](/docs/guides/consumption-metrics) guide.

## Autoscaling configuration

When provisioning databases for your users, Neon automatically scales compute based on actual usage. The system monitors three metrics and scales to meet whichever requires the most resources:

- **CPU load** (targeting < 90% utilization)
- **Memory usage** (targeting < 75% utilization)
- **Local file cache** (targeting < 75% utilization)

This ensures databases get the resources they need without manual intervention.

### Configure autoscaling ranges

Set autoscaling min/max CUs to match your plan tiers (e.g., 0.25â€“0.5 for free, 0.25â€“4 for pro, higher for enterprise). Adjust over time based on observed CPU, memory, and cache pressure. For additional information, see the [autoscaling documentation](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

### Update existing endpoints

Adjust autoscaling limits when users upgrade/downgrade:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/$PROJECT_ID/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "endpoint": {
      "autoscaling_limit_min_cu": 0.25,
      "autoscaling_limit_max_cu": 4
    }
  }'
```

### Disable suspend on critical endpoints

Prevent suspension to avoid cold starts. Disabling suspend keeps compute always on and may increase cost. Note: `suspend_timeout_seconds: 0` uses the default timeout; set to `-1` to disable suspension.

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/$PROJECT_ID/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "endpoint": {
      "suspend_timeout_seconds": -1
    }
  }'
```

**Cost implications**: Users are billed for actual compute usage within the configured range.

## Authentication setup

Add production-ready authentication and access control to agent-generated apps to automatically sync user data to your database. See [how Neon Auth works](/docs/neon-auth/how-it-works) for more information and examples.

### Initialize Neon Auth

```bash
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/auth/create" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "auth_provider": "stack",
    "project_id": "shiny-wind-028834",
    "branch_id": "br-aged-salad-637688",
    "database_name": "app_db",
    "role_name": "app_user"
  }'
```

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "auth_provider": "stack",
  "auth_provider_project_id": "proj-example-123",
  "pub_client_key": "pck_example123",
  "secret_server_key": "ssk_example123",
  "jwks_url": "https://api.stack-auth.com/api/v1/projects/proj-example-123/.well-known/jwks.json",
  "schema_name": "neon_auth",
  "table_name": "users_sync"
}
```

### Generate SDK keys

```bash
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/auth/keys" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "shiny-wind-028834",
    "auth_provider": "stack"
  }'
```

### Configure OAuth providers

```bash
# Development (using shared keys)
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834/auth/oauth_providers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "google"}'

# Production (with custom keys)
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834/auth/oauth_providers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "github",
    "client_id": "Iv1.xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "client_secret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }'
```

**Available providers**: github, google, and microsoft

### Create users programmatically

```bash
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/auth/user" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "shiny-wind-028834",
    "auth_provider": "stack",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "name": "Admin User"
  }'
```

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "id": "user-id-123"
}
```

### Query synced users

Users are automatically synced to your database:

```sql
-- Query users directly from your database
SELECT id, email, name, signed_in_at
FROM neon_auth.users_sync
WHERE email_verified = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Snapshot versioning

Build full version history into your platform. Your agent can snapshot schema and data at any moment, allowing users to roll back to working versions, preview earlier states, or safely test changes.

**When to use snapshots vs branches:**

- **Snapshots with `finalize_restore: true`**: For production versioning - preserves your connection string during rollback
- **Snapshots with `finalize_restore: false`**: For preview/testing - creates a new branch with new connection string
- **Branches**: For development work - always creates new connection string

**Note:** Snapshots can only be created from root branches (branches with no parent, typically named `main` or `production`).

### Create a snapshot (checkpoint)

Use the snapshots API to create a point-in-time database version. Snapshot creation happens asynchronously in the background:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834/branches/br-aged-salad-637688/snapshot?name=version-1.0&expires_at=2025-12-31T23:59:59Z" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "snapshot": {
    "id": "snap-123456",
    "parent_id": "br-aged-salad-637688",
    "parent_lsn": "0/1DE2850",
    "parent_timestamp": "2025-11-15T10:30:00Z",
    "name": "version-1.0",
    "created_at": "2025-11-15T10:30:00Z",
    "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  },
  "operations": [
    {
      "id": "op-123456",
      "status": "running",
      "action": "create_snapshot"
    }
  ]
}
```

The snapshot is created asynchronously. The database remains fully accessible during creation - no polling required.

### Restore a snapshot (rollback)

Restore to your main branch to rollback while preserving the connection string:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834/snapshots/snap-123456/restore" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target_branch_id": "br-aged-salad-637688",
    "finalize_restore": true
  }'
```

**Important steps for a restore with `finalize_restore: true`:**

1. Poll operations until complete (the compute endpoint is transferred during restore). Connecting early may return old data.
2. Delete the orphaned "(old)" branch created as a backup to avoid storage costs.
3. Then reconnect using the same connection string; it now points to the restored state.

### Create preview from snapshot

Create a temporary preview branch from a snapshot without affecting production:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834/snapshots/snap-123456/restore" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "preview-version-1.0",
    "finalize_restore": false
  }'
```

**Note:** With `finalize_restore: false`:

- Creates a new branch with its own connection string
- Production database remains unchanged
- No operation polling required (production endpoint not affected)
- Remember to delete preview branches after use to avoid costs

### List snapshots (version history)

```bash
curl -X GET "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834/snapshots" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "snapshots": [
    {
      "id": "snap-123456",
      "parent_id": "br-aged-salad-637688",
      "name": "preview-version-1.0",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "snap-789012",
      "parent_id": "br-aged-salad-637688",
      "name": "preview-version-2.0",
      "created_at": "2024-01-16T14:20:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Delete snapshot

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/shiny-wind-028834/snapshots/snap-123456" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

## Point-in-time recovery (PITR)

Create a new branch at a past point in time without a pre-created snapshot. Useful for forensics, previewing historical states, or extracting specific rows without affecting production.

```bash
# Create a branch at a past point in time (PITR); production remains unchanged
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/$PROJECT_ID/branches" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "branch": {
      "parent_id": "$ROOT_BRANCH_ID",
      "name": "pitr-2025-01-16-1420",
      "parent_timestamp": "2025-01-16T14:20:00Z"
    }
  }'
```

## Data API

Transform your database into REST endpoints automatically. The Data API provides instant HTTP access to your database without writing backend code, powered by PostgREST.

### Enable Data API

```bash
# Enable with Neon Auth (recommended)
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/$PROJECT_ID/branches/$BRANCH_ID/data-api/app_db" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"auth_provider": "neon_auth"}'
```

The response includes your unique Data API endpoint URL. Once enabled, you can query your database using standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) with PostgREST-compatible client libraries.

See the [Data API guide](/docs/data-api/get-started) for complete setup, query examples, RLS configuration, and supported client libraries.

## Rate limiting

Neon enforces 700 requests/minute (40 req/sec burst) rate limit by default, as described in the [API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/api-rate-limiting).

For high-volume agent platforms, apply for the [Neon Agent Plan](/use-cases/ai-agents) to get custom rate limits.

## Best practices

### Connection management

- Use pooled connections (`-pooler` suffix) for serverless environments
- Use direct connections for long-running servers
- Connection limits vary by compute size, see [connection limits documentation](/docs/connect/connection-pooling#connection-limits-without-connection-pooling)

### Cost optimization

- Set `autoscaling_limit_min_cu` to 0.25 for scale-to-zero
- Configure appropriate `suspend_timeout_seconds` (300-900 seconds)
- Use smaller compute units for development branches
- Delete orphaned branches after restore - they accumulate storage costs (see [restore snapshots](#restore-a-snapshot-rollback) for cleanup code)
- Disable suspend on critical endpoints to eliminate cold starts, or increase `suspend_timeout_seconds` to reduce suspends. Note: keeping endpoints warm incurs idle compute cost.

## Troubleshooting common issues

| Issue                                       | Cause                                            | Solution                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Snapshot creation fails**                 | Attempting to snapshot a non-root branch         | Only snapshot branches with no parent (check `parent_id` is null)                      |
| **Connection shows old data after restore** | Connecting before operations complete            | Always poll operations to terminal state after a restore with `finalize_restore: true` |
| **Accumulating storage costs**              | Orphaned branches from restores not deleted      | Delete branches ending with "(old)" after each restore                                 |
| **"Branch has children" error**             | Other branches depend on this branch             | Delete child branches first, or use snapshots instead of branches                      |
| **Connection string changed**               | Created new branch instead of restoring snapshot | Use a restore with `finalize_restore: true` to preserve connection string              |
