Inngest is a popular framework for building AI RAG and Agentic workflows. [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/?utm_source=neon&utm_medium=inngest-ai-integration) provides automatic retries, caching along with concurrency and throttling management and AI requests offloading.

Inngest also integrates with Neon Postgres to trigger workflows based on database changes.

## Build RAG with `step.run()`

Inngest provides a `step.run()` API that allows you to compose your workflows into cacheable, retryable, and concurrency-safe steps:

In the above workflow, a network issue prevented the AI workflow to connect to the vector store. Fortunately, Inngest retries the failed step and uses the cached results from the previous steps, avoiding an unnecessary additional OpenAI call.

This workflow translates to the following code:

```typescript
import { inngest } from '@/inngest';
import { getToolsForMessage, vectorSearch } from '@/helpers';

export const ragWorkflow = client.createFunction(
  { id: 'rag-workflow', concurrency: 10 },
  { event: 'chat.message' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { message } = event.data;

    const page = await step.run('tools.search', async () => {
      // Calls OpenAI
      return getToolsForMessage(message);
    });

    await step.run('vector-search', async () => {
      // Search in Neon's vector store
      return vectorSearch(page);
    });

    // step 3 and 4...
  }
);
```

Configuring [concurrency](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/concurrency?utm_source=neon&utm_medium=inngest-ai-integration) or [throttling](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/throttling?utm_source=neon&utm_medium=inngest-ai-integration) to match your LLM provider's limits is achieved with a single line of code.

Learn more about using Inngest for RAG in the following article: [Multi-Tenant RAG With One Neon Project Per User](/blog/multi-tenant-rag).

## AI requests offloading: `step.ai.infer()`

Inngest also provides a `step.ai.infer()` API that offloads AI requests.
By using `step.ai.infer()` your AI workflows will pause while waiting for the slow LLM response, avoiding unnecessary compute use on Serverless environments:

The previous RAG workflow can be rewritten to use [`step.ai.infer()`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/step-ai-orchestration?utm_source=neon&utm_medium=inngest-ai-integration#step-ai-infer) to offload the AI request to the LLM provider:

```typescript
import { inngest } from '@/inngest';
import { getPromptForToolsSearch, vectorSearch } from '@/helpers';

export const ragWorkflow = client.createFunction(
  { id: 'rag-workflow', concurrency: 10 },
  { event: 'chat.message' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { message } = event.data;

    const prompt = getPromptForToolsSearch(message);
    await step.ai.infer('tools.search', {
      model: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o' }),
      body: {
        messages: prompt,
      },
    });

    // other steps...
  }
);
```

`step.ai.infer()`, combined with Neon's Scale-to-zero feature, allows you to build AI workflows that scale costs with its success!

## Trigger AI workflows based on database changes

Inngest also integrates with Neon Postgres to trigger AI workflows based on database changes:

![Inngest integrates with Neon Postgres to trigger AI workflows based on database changes](/docs/guides/inngest.jpg)

This integration allows you to trigger AI workflows based on database changes, such as generating embeddings as soon as a new row is inserted into a table (see example below).

<br />

Configure the Inngests Neon integration to trigger AI workflows from your Neon database changes [by following this guide](/guides/trigger-serverless-functions).
