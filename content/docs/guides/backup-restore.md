<Admonition type="comingSoon" title="Snapshots in Early Access">
The new **Backup & restore** page in the Neon Console, which introduces the new **snapshots** feature, is available for members of our Early Access Program. Read more about joining up [here](/docs/introduction/early-access).
</Admonition>

Use the **Backup & restore** page in the Neon Console to instantly restore a branch to a previous state or create and restore snapshots of your data. This feature combines **instant point-in-time restore** and **snapshots** to help you recover from accidental changes, data loss, or schema issues.

## Instantly restore a branch

Instantly restore your branch to a specific time in its history.

> Instant restore is only supported for root branches. Typically, this is your project's `production` branch. [Learn more](/docs/manage/branches#root-branch).

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

You can restore from any time that falls within your project's [restore window](/docs/manage/projects#configure-your-restore-window).

1. **Select a time**

   Click the date & time selector, choose a date & time, and click **Restore**.

   ![Backup and restore select a restore time](/docs/guides/backup_restore_select_time.png)

   You'll see a confirmation modal that outlines what will happen:
   - Your branch will be restored to its state at the selected date & time
   - Your current branch will be saved as a backup, in case you want to revert

   ![Backup and restore preview data](/docs/guides/backup_restore_preview_modal.png)

   At this point, you can either click **Restore** to proceed or select **Preview data** to inspect the data first.

2. **Preview the data**

   To preview the data to make sure you’ve selected the right restore point, you can:
   - **Browse data** in the **Tables** view to explore a read-only view of the data at the selected point in time
   - **Query data** directly from the restore page to run read-only SQL against the selected restore point
   - **Compare schemas** with the schema diff tool to see how your current schema differs from the one at the selected restore point

   ![Backup and restore preview data options](/docs/guides/backup_restore_preview_options.png)

3. **Restore**

   Click **Restore** to complete the restore operation, or **Cancel** to back out. You can also restore directly from any of the **Preview data** pages.

   When you restore, a backup branch is automatically created (named `<branch_name>_old_<timestamp>`) in case you need to revert back. You can find this branch on the **Branches** page.

   ![Backup branch on the Branches page](/docs/guides/backup_restore_backup_branch.png)

   For information about removing backup branches, see [Deleting backup branches](/docs/introduction/branch-restore#deleting-backup-branches).

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

To restore a branch to an earlier point in time, use the syntax `^self` in the `<source id|name>` field of the `branches restore` command. For example:

```bash shouldWrap
neon branches restore development ^self@2025-01-01T00:00:00Z --preserve-under-name development_old
```

This command resets the target branch `development` to its state at the start of 2025. The command also preserves the original state of the branch in a backup file called `development_old` using the `preserve-under-name` parameter (mandatory when resetting to self).

For full CLI documentation for `branches restore`, see [branches restore](/docs/reference/cli-branches#restore).

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

To restore a branch using the API, use the endpoint:

```bash
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id_to_restore}/restore
```

This endpoint lets you restore a branch using the following request parameters:

| Parameter               | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **source_branch_id**    | `string` | Yes      | The ID of the branch you want to restore from.<br /><br />To restore to the latest data (head), omit `source_timestamp` and `source_lsn`.<br /><br />To restore a branch to its own history (`source_branch_id` equals branch's own Id), you must include:<br />- A time period: `source_timestamp` or `source_lsn`<br />- A backup branch: `preserve_under_name`                         |
| **source_lsn**          | `string` | No       | A Log Sequence Number (LSN) on the source branch. The branch will be restored with data up to this LSN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **source_timestamp**    | `string` | No       | A timestamp indicating the point in time on the source branch to restore from. Use RFC 3339 format for the date-time string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **preserve_under_name** | `string` | No       | If specified, a backup is created: the latest version of the branch's state is preserved under a new branch using the specified name.<br /><br />**Note:** This field is required if:<br />- The branch has children. All child branches will be moved to the newly created branch.<br />- You are restoring a branch to its own history (`source_branch_id` equals the branch's own ID). |

#### Restoring a branch to its own history

In the following example, we are restoring branch `br-twilight-river-31791249` to an earlier point in time, `2024-02-27T00:00:00Z`, with a new backup branch named `backup-before-restore`. Note that the branch id in the `url` matches the value for `source_branch_id`.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/floral-disk-86322740/branches/br-twilight-river-31791249/restore \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "source_branch_id": "br-twilight-river-31791249",
  "source_timestamp": "2024-02-27T00:00:00Z",
  "preserve_under_name": "backup-before-restore"
}
' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Create snapshots manually

Snapshots capture the state of your branch at a point in time. You can create snapshots manually or [schedule](#schedule-snapshots) them.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a snapshot manually, click **Create snapshot**. This captures the current state of your data and saves it as a **Manual snapshot**. It's a good idea to create a snapshot before making significant changes to your schema or data.

![Backup branch on the Branches page](/docs/guides/backup_restore_create_snapshot.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

You can create a snapshot from a branch using the [Create snapshot](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createSnapshot) endpoint. A snapshot can be created from a specific timestamp (RFC 3339 format) or LSN (e.g. 16/B3733C50) within the branch's restore window. The `timestamp` and `lsn` parameters are mutually exclusive — you can use one or the other, not both.

```
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/project_id/branches/branch_id/snapshot" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "timestamp": "2025-07-29T21:00:00Z",
    "name": "my_snapshot",
    "expires_at": "2025-08-05T22:00:00Z"
  }' |jq
```

The parameters used in the example above:

- `timestamp`: A point in time to create the snapshot from (RFC 3339 format).
- `name`: A user-defined name for the snapshot.
- `expires_at`: The timestamp when the snapshot will be automatically deleted (RFC 3339 format).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Schedule snapshots

You can automate snapshot creation by setting a snapshot schedule for a branch.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To edit the snapshot schedule for a branch:

1. Click **Edit schedule**.
2. In the **Edit snapshot schedule** modal, configure:
   - **Frequency** – Daily, weekly, or monthly snapshots.
   - **Retention** – How long to retain snapshots before they expire.
   - **Custom retention rules** – Optionally keep specific daily or weekly snapshots for longer.

   For example, you can configure daily snapshots at 01:00 UTC, keep Monday snapshots for a few weeks, and retain monthly snapshots for several months.

3. Click **Update schedule** to apply your changes.

   Snapshots created via the schedule are listed under the Snapshots section, along with manual snapshots.

   ![snapshot schedule dialog](/docs/guides/snapshot_schedule.png)

   <Admonition type="tip">
   The Neon API provides finer-grained control over snapshot scheduling. Learn more by clicking the **API** tab above.
   </Admonition>

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

### Set a snapshot schedule

This example sets a snapshot schedule for a Neon branch. It configures a snapshot to be taken on December 31 at 23:00 (11 PM), with a retention period of one hour (3600 seconds). The `frequency` field must be set to a supported value such as `"monthly"`, `"weekly"`, or `"daily"` depending on your use case. Replace `project_id`, `branch_id`, and `$NEON_API_KEY` with your actual project ID, branch ID, and API token.

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/{project_id}/branch_id/{branch_id}/snapshot_schedule" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "schedule": [
      {
        "frequency": "string",
        "hour": 23,
        "day": 31,
        "month": 12,
        "retention_seconds": 3600
      }
    ]
  }' |jq
```

### Retrieve a snapshot schedule

This example shows how to retrieve a snapshot schedule for a branch. Replace `project_id`, `branch_id`, and `$NEON_API_KEY` with your actual project ID, branch ID, and API token.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/project_id/branches/branch_id/snapshot_schedule" \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Restore from a snapshot

You can restore from a snapshot using one of two methods:

- **One-step restore** – Instantly restore data from the snapshot into the existing branch. The branch name and connection string remain the same, but the branch ID changes.
- **Multi-step restore** – Create a new branch from the snapshot. Use this option if you want to inspect or test the data before switching to the new branch.

### One-step restore

Use this option if you want to restore the snapshot data immediately without inspecting the data first.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

1. Locate the snapshot you want to use and click **Restore → One-step restore**.

   ![One step restore option](/docs/guides/one_step_restore.png)

2. The **One-step restore** modal explains the operation:
   - The restore operation will occur instantly
   - The current branch will be restored to the snapshot state
   - A branch named `<branch_name (old)>` will be created as a backup

   ![One step restore confirmation modal](/docs/guides/one_step_restore_modal.png)

   Click **Restore** to proceed with the operation.

3. Your branch is immediately restored to the snapshot state, and the `<branch_name>_old` branch is created, which you'll find on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console, as shown here:
   ![Branches page that shows the backup branch](/docs/guides/one_step_restore_branches_page.png)

   After you verify that the restore operation was successful, you can delete the backup branch if you no longer need it.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

A one-step restore operation is performed using the [Restore snapshot](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/restoreSnapshot) endpoint. This operation creates a new branch, restores the snapshot to the new branch, and moves computes from your current branch to the new branch.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/project_id/snapshots/snapshot_id/restore?name=restored_branch" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "name": "restored_branch",
    "finalize_restore": false
  }' |jq
```

Parameters:

- `name`: (Optional) Name of the new branch with the restored snapshot data. If not provided, a default branch name will be generated.
- `finalize_restore`: Set to `true` to finalize the restore immediately. Finalizing the restore moves computes from your current branch to the new branch with the restored snapshot data for a seamless restore operation — no need to change the connection details in your application.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Multi-step restore

Use this option if you need to inspect the restored data before you switch over to the new branch.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

1. Locate the snapshot you want to use and click **Restore → Multi-step restore**.
   ![Multi-step restore option](/docs/guides/multi_step_restore.png)
2. The **Multi-step restore** modal explains the operation:
   - The restore will occur instantly
   - Your current branch will remain unchanged
   - A new branch with the snapshot data will be created

   ![Multi-step restore confirmation modal](/docs/guides/multi_step_restore_modal.png)

3. Clicking **Restore** creates the new branch with the restored data and directs you to the **Branch overview** page where you can:
   - **Get connection details** for the new branch to preview the data restored from the snapshot
   - **Migrate connections and settings** to move your database URLs and compute settings from the old branch to the new branch so you don't have to update the connection configuration in your application

   ![Branch overview page](/docs/guides/branch_overview_page.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

1.  **Restore the snapshot to a new branch**

    The first step in a multi-step restore operation is to restore the snapshot to a new branch using the [Restore snapshot](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/restoreSnapshot) endpoint:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/project_id/snapshots/snapshot_id/restore" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
       "name": "my_restored_branch",
       "finalize_restore": false
    }' |jq
    ```

    Parameters:
    - `name`: (Optional) Name of the new branch with the restored snapshot data. If not provided, a default branch name will be generated.
    - `finalize_restore`: Set to `false` so that you can inspect the new branch before finalizing the restore operation.

       <Admonition type="note">
          You can find the `snapshot_id` using the [List project snapshots](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listSnapshots) endpoint.

             ```bash
             curl -X GET "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/project_id/snapshots" \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" |jq
             ```

       </Admonition>

2.  **Inspect the new branch**

    After restoring the snapshot, you can connect to the new branch and run queries to inspect the data. You can get the branch connection string from the Neon Console or using the [Retrieve connection URI](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconnectionuri) endpoint.

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/project_id/connection_uri?branch_id=branch_id&database_name=db_name&role_name=role_name&pooled=true' \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' |jq
    ```

3.  **Finalize the restore**

    If you're satisfied with the data on the new branch, finalize the restore operation using the [Finalize restore](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/finalize_restore) endpoint. This step performs the following actions:
    - Moves your original branch's computes to the new branch and restarts the computes
    - Renames the new branch to original branch's name
    - Renames the original branch to `<branch_name> (old)`.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/project_id/branches/branch_id/finalize_restore" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' |jq
    ```

    Parameters:
    - `project_id`: The Neon project ID.
    - `branch_id`: The branch ID of the branch created by the snapshot restore operation.
