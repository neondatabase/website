User authentication is a critical requirement for web applications. Modern applications require advanced features like social login and multi-factor authentication besides the regular login flow. Additionally, managing personally identifiable information (PII) requires a secure solution compliant with data protection regulations.

<Admonition type="comingSoon">
Looking to manage **authorization** along with authentication? Currently in Early Access for select users, [Neon RLS Authorize](/docs/guides/neon-authorize) brings JSON Web Token (JWT) authorization directly to Postgres, where you can use Row-level Security (RLS) policies to manage access at the database level.
</Admonition>

[Clerk](https://clerk.com/) is a user authentication and identity management platform that provides these features out of the box. It comes with adapters for popular web frameworks, making it easy to integrate with an application backed by a Neon Postgres database.

In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a simple Next.js application using Neon Postgres as the database, and add user authentication using [Clerk](https://clerk.com/). We will go over how to:

- Set up a Next.js project with Clerk for authentication
- Create a Neon Postgres database and connect it to your application
- Define a database schema using Drizzle ORM and generate migrations
- Store and retrieve user data associated with Clerk user IDs

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account for user authentication. Clerk provides a free plan that you can use to get started.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.

## Initialize your Next.js project

We will create a simple web app that lets you add a favorite quote to the home page, and edit it afterward. Run the following command in your terminal to create a new `Next.js` project:

```bash
npx create-next-app guide-neon-next-clerk --typescript --eslint --tailwind --use-npm --no-src-dir --app --import-alias "@/*"
```

Now, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/serverless drizzle-orm
npm install -D drizzle-kit dotenv
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

We use the `@neondatabase/serverless` package as the Postgres client, and `drizzle-orm`, a lightweight typescript ORM, to interact with the database. `@clerk/nextjs` is the Clerk SDK for Next.js applications. We also use `dotenv` to manage environment variables and the `drizzle-kit` CLI tool for generating database migrations.

Also, add a `.env` file to the root of your project, which we'll use to store Neon/Clerk connection parameters:

```bash
touch .env
```

Make sure to add an entry for `.env` to your `.gitignore` file, so that it's not committed to your repository.

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

1. Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.
2. Select an existing project or click the **New Project** button to create a new one.
3. Choose the desired region and Postgres version for your project, then click **Create Project**.

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

You can find your database connection string by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Add this connection string to the `.env` file in your Next.js project.

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
```

## Configuring Clerk for authentication

### Create a Clerk application

1. Log in to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). Select `Create Application` to create a new app.
2. In the dialog that appears, provide a name for your application and a few sign-in options. For this tutorial, we'll use `Email`, `Google` and `GitHub` as allowed sign-in methods.

### Retrieve your API keys

From the `Configure` tab, click on **API Keys** to find your API keys, needed to authenticate your application with Clerk. Select the `Next.js` option to get them as environment variables for your Next.js project. It should look similar to this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=**************
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=**************
```

Add these variables to the `.env` file in your Next.js project.

## Implementing the application

### Define your database connection and schema

Create a `db` folder inside the `app/` directory. This is where we'll define the database schema and connection code.

Now, add the file `app/db/index.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
/// app/db/index.ts

import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
import { UserMessages } from './schema';

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error('DATABASE_URL must be a Neon postgres connection string');
}

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
export const db = drizzle(sql, {
  schema: { UserMessages },
});
```

This exports a `db` instance that we can use to execute queries against the Neon database.

Next, create a `schema.ts` file inside the `app/db` directory to define the database schema:

```typescript
/// app/db/schema.ts

import { pgTable, text, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const UserMessages = pgTable('user_messages', {
  user_id: text('user_id').primaryKey().notNull(),
  createTs: timestamp('create_ts').defaultNow().notNull(),
  message: text('message').notNull(),
});
```

This schema defines a table `user_messages` to store a message for each user, with the `user_id` provided by Clerk as the primary key.

### Generate and run migrations

We'll use the `drizzle-kit` CLI tool to generate migrations for the schema we defined. To configure how it connects to the database, add a `drizzle.config.ts` file at the project root.

```typescript
/// drizzle.config.ts

import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit';
import 'dotenv/config';

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) throw new Error('DATABASE_URL not found in environment');

export default {
  schema: './app/db/schema.ts',
  out: './drizzle',
  driver: 'pg',
  dbCredentials: {
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
  strict: true,
} satisfies Config;
```

Now, generate the migration files by running the following command:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
```

This will create a `drizzle` folder at the project root with the migration files. To apply the migration to the database, run:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push:pg
```

The `user_messages` table will now be visible in the Neon console.

### Add authentication middleware

The `Clerk` sdk handles user authentication and session management for us. Create a new file `middleware.ts` in the root directory so
all the app routes are protected by Clerk's authentication:

```typescript
/// middleware.ts

import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export default clerkMiddleware();

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
};
```

Next, we wrap the full application with the `ClerkProvider` component, so all pages have access to the current session and user context. Replace the contents of the `app/layout.tsx` file with the following:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
import './globals.css';
import { ClerkProvider, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Neon-Next-Clerk guide',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body className={inter.className}>
          <div className="bg-white p-4">
            <UserButton showName={true}></UserButton>
          </div>
          {children}
        </body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

This also adds a `UserButton` component to the layout, which displays the user's name and avatar when logged in.

### Add interactivity to the application

Our application has a single page that lets the logged-in user store their favorite quote and displays it. We implement `Next.js` server action to handle the form submission and database interaction.

Create a new file at `app/actions.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
'use server';

import { currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { UserMessages } from './db/schema';
import { db } from './db';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';

export async function createUserMessage(formData: FormData) {
  const user = await currentUser();
  if (!user) throw new Error('User not found');

  const message = formData.get('message') as string;
  await db.insert(UserMessages).values({
    user_id: user.id,
    message,
  });
  redirect('/');
}

export async function deleteUserMessage() {
  const user = await currentUser();
  if (!user) throw new Error('User not found');

  await db.delete(UserMessages).where(eq(UserMessages.user_id, user.id));
  redirect('/');
}
```

The `addUserMessage` function inserts a new message into the `user_messages` table, while `deleteUserMessage` removes the message associated with the current user.

Next, we implement a minimal UI to interact with these functions. Replace the contents of the `app/page.tsx` file with the following:

```tsx
import { createUserMessage, deleteUserMessage } from './actions';
import { db } from './db';
import { currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

async function getUserMessage() {
  const user = await currentUser();
  if (!user) throw new Error('User not found');
  return db.query.UserMessages.findFirst({
    where: (messages, { eq }) => eq(messages.user_id, user.id),
  });
}

export default async function Home() {
  const existingMessage = await getUserMessage();
  const ui = existingMessage ? (
    <div className="w-2/3 text-center">
      <h1 className="text-3xl">{existingMessage.message}</h1>
      <form action={deleteUserMessage} className="mb-4 w-full rounded px-8 pb-8 pt-6">
        <div className="w-full text-center">
          <input
            type="submit"
            value={'Delete Quote'}
            className="text-gray-800 cursor-pointer rounded bg-[#00E699] px-4 py-2 font-semibold transition-colors hover:bg-[#00e5BF] focus:outline-none"
          />
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  ) : (
    <form action={createUserMessage} className="w-2/3 rounded px-8 shadow-md">
      <div className="mb-6">
        <input
          type="text"
          name="message"
          placeholder="Mistakes are the portals of discovery - James Joyce"
          className="text-gray-700 w-full appearance-none rounded border p-3 text-center leading-tight focus:outline-none"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="w-full text-center">
        <input
          type="submit"
          value={'Save Quote'}
          className="text-gray-800 cursor-pointer rounded bg-[#00E699] px-4 py-2 font-semibold transition-colors hover:bg-[#00e5BF] focus:outline-none"
        />
      </div>
    </form>
  );
  return (
    <main className="align-center -mt-16 flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center px-24">
      <h2 className="text-gray-400 pb-6 text-2xl">
        {existingMessage ? 'Your quote is wonderful...' : 'Save an inspiring quote for yourself...'}
      </h2>
      {ui}
    </main>
  );
}
```

This implements a form with a single text field that lets the user input a quote, and submit it, whereby it gets stored in the database, associated with their `Clerk` user ID. If a quote is already stored, it displays it and provides a button to delete it.

The `currentuser` hook from `@clerk/nextjs/server` provides the current user's information, which we use to interact with the database on their behalf.

## Running the application

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action. When running for the first time, you'll be prompted to sign in with Clerk. Once authenticated, you'll be able to visit the home page, add a quote, and see it displayed.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we walked through setting up a simple Next.js application with user authentication using Clerk and a Neon Postgres database. We defined a database schema using Drizzle ORM, generated migrations, and interacted with the database to store and retrieve user data.

Next, we can add more routes and features to the application. The Clerk middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access any app routes, and the `ClerkProvider` component provides the user context to each of them.

To view and manage the users who authenticated with your application, you can navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/).
