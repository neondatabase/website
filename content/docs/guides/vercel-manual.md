This guide describes how to manually connect a Vercel project to a Neon database.

<Admonition type="note">
For other Vercel integration options, refer to the [Neon and Vercel integration overview](/docs/guides/vercel-overview).
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- A Neon project. If you do not have one, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com).
- A project deployed to Vercel. If you do not have one, see [Creating a project](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#creating-a-project), in the _Vercel documentation_.

## Gather your Neon connection details

You can find the connection details for your database by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

The connection string includes the role name, hostname, and database name. For example:

```text
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
           ^              ^                                               ^
           |- <role>      |- <hostname>                                   |- <database>
```

- role name: `alex`
- hostname: `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
- database name: `dbname`

## Configure project environment variables in Vercel

The environment variables required to connect your application to Neon depend on your application. Some applications use a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with a database connection string:

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
```

Other applications may use `PG*` environment variables to define database connection details:

```text
PGUSER=alex
PGHOST=ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGDATABASE=dbname
PGPASSWORD=AbC123dEf
PGPORT=5432
```

<Admonition type="note">
Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`.
</Admonition>

To configure the environment variables required by your application:

<Admonition type="note">
Vercel environment variables can also be configured when you first deploy an application to Vercel.
</Admonition>

1. Navigate to the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/).
1. Select your Vercel project.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **Environment variables**.
1. Enter the environment variable name in the **Key** field and add the value.
1. Click **Add another** if you need to add more variables.
1. Select the Vercel environments to which the variable(s) will apply (**Production**, **Preview**, **Development**).
1. Click **Save**.

You must redeploy your application in Vercel for the environment variable settings to take effect.
