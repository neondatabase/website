In this tutorial, we'll walk through some user authentication flows using our [demo todos](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon-auth-demo-app) application, showing how Neon Auth automatically syncs user profiles to your database, and how that can simplify your code.

<FeatureBetaProps feature_name="Neon Auth" />

## Prerequisites

Follow the readme to set up the [Neon Auth Demo App](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon-auth-demo-app): Next.js + Drizzle + Stack Auth

> _Use the keys provided by Neon Auth in your project's **Auth** page rather than creating a separate Stack Auth project._

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon-auth-demo-app.git
```

<Steps>

## Instant user sync

Sign up as Bob, then as Doug in a private window.

Open the Neon Console to see their profiles automatically synced:

![Users sync table showing automatically synced profiles](/docs/guides/neon_auth_users_sync.png)

_No custom sync logic required; profiles are always up-to-date in Postgres._

## Easy user-data joins

Add a few todos as each user.

![Todo list showing todos with user attribution](/docs/guides/neon_auth_demo_todos.png)

Here's the code that builds the todo list:

```ts {7-11,14,15} showLineNumbers
// app/actions.tsx
export async function getTodos() {
  return fetchWithDrizzle(async (db) => {
    return db
      .select({
        id: schema.todos.id,
        task: schema.todos.task,
        isComplete: schema.todos.isComplete,
        insertedAt: schema.todos.insertedAt,
        owner: {
          id: users.id,
          email: users.email,
        },
      })
      .from(schema.todos)
      .leftJoin(users, eq(schema.todos.ownerId, users.id))
      .orderBy(asc(schema.todos.insertedAt));
  });
}
```

Highlighted code shows:

- User email and ID included in each todo response
- Automatic join between todos and the `users_sync` table

_User data is always available for joins and queries; no extra API calls or sync logic needed._

## Collaboration and analytics

Switch between Bob and Doug's accounts to mark some todos complete - the dashboard updates in real-time.

![Team progress dashboard showing real-time task completion](/docs/guides/neon_auth_demo_progress.png)

Here's the code that populates this live dashboard:

```ts showLineNumbers
// app/users-stats.tsx
async function getUserStats() {
  const stats = await fetchWithDrizzle((db) =>
    db
      .select({
        email: users.email, // [!code highlight]
        name: users.name, // [!code highlight]
        complete: db.$count(todos, and(eq(todos.isComplete, true), eq(todos.ownerId, users.id))),
        total: db.$count(todos, eq(todos.ownerId, users.id)),
      })
      .from(users) // [!code highlight]
      .innerJoin(todos, eq(todos.ownerId, users.id)) // [!code highlight]
      .where(isNull(users.deletedAt))
      .groupBy(users.email, users.name, users.id)
  );

  return stats;
}
```

Highlighted code shows:

- Direct access to synced user profiles
- Simple joins between app data and user data

_Build multi-user features without writing complex sync code; user data is always available and up-to-date in your database._

## Safe user deletion and data cleanup

_Let's simulate what happens when an admin deletes a user account._

To test this, delete Doug's profile directly from the database:

```sql
DELETE FROM neon_auth.users_sync WHERE email LIKE '%doug%';
```

Refresh the todo list, and... ugh, _ghost todos!_ ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»

_(Doug may be gone, but his todos aren't.)_

![Todo list showing orphaned todos with no owner](/docs/guides/neon_auth_demo_ghosts.png)

_In production, this could happen automatically when a user is deleted from your auth provider. Either way, their todos become orphaned - no owner, but still in your database._

**Why?**

The starter schema does not include `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so when a user profile is deleted (whether by admin action or auth sync), their todos are left behind. This can clutter your app and confuse your users.

## Safe user deletion and data cleanup: FIXED

_Let's prevent ghost todos with proper database constraints._

Adding foreign key contraints is a best practice we explain in more detail [here](/docs/guides/neon-auth-best-practices#foreign-keys-and-the-users_sync-table).

**Step 1: Clean up your demo**  
Orphaned todos will block adding a foreign key. Use Neon's instant restore to roll back your branch:

Go to the **Restore** page in the Neon Console and roll back to a few minutes ago, before we deleted Doug.

> If you have the Neon CLI installed, you can also use:

````bash shouldWrap
> neon branches restore production ^self@<timestamp> --preserve-under-name production_backup
> ```

**Step 2: Add the foreign key constraint**

```sql
ALTER TABLE todos
ADD CONSTRAINT todos_owner_id_fk
  FOREIGN KEY (owner_id)
  REFERENCES neon_auth.users_sync(id)
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
````

**Step 3: Test it**

Delete Doug's profile again:

```sql
DELETE FROM neon_auth.users_sync WHERE email LIKE '%doug%';
```

Refresh the todo list. This time Doug's todos are automatically cleaned up!

![Todo list showing clean state after user deletion](/docs/guides/neon_auth_demo_no_ghosts.png)

_With this constraint in place, when Neon Auth syncs a user deletion, all their todos will be cleaned up automatically._

</Steps>

## Recap

With Neon Auth, you get:

- âœ… Synchronized user profiles
- âœ… Efficient data queries
- âœ… Automated data cleanup (with foreign key constraints)
- âœ… Simple user data integration

Neon Auth handles user-profile synchronization, and a single foreign key takes care of cleanup.
