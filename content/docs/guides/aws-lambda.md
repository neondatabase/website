AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is a convenient and cost-effective solution for running various types of workloads, including those that require a database.

This guide describes how to set up a Neon database and connect to it from an AWS Lambda function using Node.js as the runtime environment. It covers:

- Creating a Lambda function using the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/), which is a serverless application lifecycle management framework.
- Connecting your Lambda function to a Neon database.
- Deploying the Lambda function to AWS.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, see [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up/) for instructions.
- An AWS account. You can create a free AWS account at [AWS Free Plan](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). An [IAM User and Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) are required to programmatically interact with your AWS account. You must provide these credentials when deploying the Serverless Framework project.
- A Service Framework account. You can sign up at [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/).

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a table in Neon

To create a table, navigate to the **SQL Editor** in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/):

In the SQL Editor, run the following queries to create a `users` table and insert some data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES
    ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'),
    ('Bob', 'bob@example.com'),
    ('Charlie', 'charlie@example.com'),
    ('Dave', 'dave@example.com'),
    ('Eve', 'eve@example.com');
```

## Create a Lambda function

Create the Lambda function using the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/):

1. Install the Serverless Framework by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g serverless
   ```

2. Create a `my-lambda` project directory and navigate to it.

   ```bash
   mkdir neon-lambda
   cd neon-lambda
   ```

3. Run the **serverless** command to create a serverless project.

   ```bash
    serverless
   ```

   Follow the prompts, as demonstrated below. You will be required to provide your AWS account credentials. The process creates an `aws-node-project` directory.

   ```bash
   ? What do you want to make? AWS - Node.js - Starter
   ? What do you want to call this project? aws-node-project

   ✔ Project successfully created in aws-node-project folder

   ? Do you want to login/register to Serverless Dashboard? Yes
   Logging into the Serverless Dashboard via the browser
   If your browser does not open automatically, please open this URL:
   https://app.serverless.com?client=cli&transactionId=jP-Zz5A9xu67PPYqzIhOe

   ✔ You are now logged into the Serverless Dashboard

   ? What application do you want to add this to? [create a new app]
   ? What do you want to name this application? aws-node-project

   ✔ Your project is ready to be deployed to Serverless Dashboard (org: "myorg", app: "aws-node-project")

   ? No AWS credentials found, what credentials do you want to use? AWS Access Role
   (most secure)

   If your browser does not open automatically, please open this URL: https://app.serverless.com/myorg/settings/providers?source=cli&providerId=new&provider=aws

   To learn more about providers, visit: http://slss.io/add-providers-dashboard
   ?
   [If you encountered an issue when setting up a provider, you may press Enter to
   skip this step]

   ✔ AWS Access Role provider was successfully created

   ? Do you want to deploy now? Yes

   Deploying aws-node-project to stage dev (us-east-1, "default" provider)

   ✔ Service deployed to stack aws-node-project-dev (71s)

   dashboard: https://app.serverless.com/myorg/apps/my-aws-node-project/aws-node-project/dev/us-east-1

   functions:
     hello: aws-node-project-dev-hello (225 kB)

   What next?
   Run these commands in the project directory:

   serverless deploy    Deploy changes
   serverless info      View deployed endpoints and resources
   serverless invoke    Invoke deployed functions
   serverless --help    Discover more commands
   ```

4. Navigate to the `aws-node-project` directory created by the previous step and install the `node-postgres` package, which you will use to connect to the database.

   ```bash
   npm install pg
   ```

   After installing the `node-postgres` package, the following dependency should be defined in your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "pg": "^8.13.1"
     }
   }
   ```

5. In the `aws-node-project` directory, add a `users.js` file, and add the following code to it:

   ```javascript
   'use strict';
   const { Client } = require('pg');

   let client;

   module.exports.getAllUsers = async () => {
     if (!client) {
       console.log('Initializing new database client');
       client = new Client({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
       try {
         await client.connect();
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error connecting to the database:', error);
         return {
           statusCode: 500,
           body: JSON.stringify({
             error: 'Failed to connect to the database',
           }),
         };
       }
     }

     try {
       const { rows } = await client.query('SELECT * FROM users');
       return {
         statusCode: 200,
         body: JSON.stringify({
           data: rows,
         }),
       };
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error executing query:', error);
       return {
         statusCode: 500,
         body: JSON.stringify({
           error: 'Failed to fetch users',
         }),
       };
     }
   };
   ```

   The code in the `users.js` file exports the `getAllUsers` function, which retrieves all rows from the `users` table and returns them as a `JSON` object in the `HTTP` response body.

   This function uses the `pg` library to connect to the Neon database. It creates a new `Client` instance and passes the database connection string, which is defined in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. It then calls `connect()` to establish a connection to the database. Finally, it uses the `query()` method to execute a `SELECT` statement that retrieves all rows from the `users` table.

   The query method returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object containing the rows retrieved by the `SELECT` statement, which the function parses to retrieve the `rows` property. Finally, the function returns an `HTTP` response with a status code of 200 and a body that contains a `JSON` object with a single `data` property, which is set to the value of the rows variable.

6. Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and the function definition to the `serverless.yml` file, which is located in your `aws-node-project` directory.

   <Admonition type="note">
   Environment variables can also be added to a `.env` file and loaded automatically with the help of the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package. For more information, see [Resolution of environment variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/environment-variables).
   </Admonition>

   You can find your database connection details by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**. Add the `DATABASE_URL` under `environment`, and add `sslmode=require` to the end of the connection string to enable SSL. The `sslmode=require` option tells Postgres to use SSL encryption and verify the server's certificate.

   ```yaml shouldWrap
   provider:
     name: aws
     runtime: nodejs14.x
     environment:
       DATABASE_URL: postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require

   functions:
     getAllUsers:
       handler: users.getAllUsers
       events:
         - httpApi:
             path: /users
             method: get
   ```

7. Deploy the serverless function using the following command:

   ```bash
   serverless deploy
   ```

   The `serverless deploy` command generates an API endpoint using [API Gateway](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api). The output of the command appears similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Deploying aws-node-project to stage dev (us-east-1, "default" provider)

   ✔ Service deployed to stack aws-node-project-dev (60s)

   dashboard: https://app.serverless.com/myorg/apps/aws-node-project/aws-node-project/dev/us-east-1

   endpoint: GET - https://ge3onb0klj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users

   functions:

     getAllUsers: aws-node-project-dev-getAllUsers (225 kB)
   ```

8. Test the generated endpoint by running a cURL command. For example:

   ```bash
   curl https://eg3onb0jkl.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users | jq
   ```

   The response returns the following data:

   ```bash
   {
     "data": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "Alice",
         "email": "alice@example.com",
         "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
       },
       {
         "id": 2,
         "name": "Bob",
         "email": "bob@example.com",
         "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
       },
       {
         "id": 3,
         "name": "Charlie",
         "email": "charlie@example.com",
         "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
       },
       {
         "id": 4,
         "name": "Dave",
         "email": "dave@example.com",
         "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
       },
       {
         "id": 5,
         "name": "Eve",
         "email": "eve@example.com",
         "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Enabling CORS

If you make API calls to the Lambda function from your app, you will likely need to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Visit the AWS documentation for information about [how to enable CORS in API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-cors.html).

You can run the following command to enable CORS to your local development environment:

```bash shouldWrap
aws apigatewayv2 update-api --api-id <api-id> --cors-configuration AllowOrigins="http://localhost:3000"
```

You can find your `api-id` on the API Gateway dashboard:
