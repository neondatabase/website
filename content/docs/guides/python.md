This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it from a simple Python application using [Psycopg (psycopg2)](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/), a popular Postgres database adapter for the Python programming language. The application connects to Neon and retrieves the current time and Postgres version.

To connect:

1. [Create a Neon Project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Create a Python project](#create-a-python-project)
3. [Store your Neon credentials](#store-your-neon-credentials)
4. [Configure your Python script](#configure-your-python-script)
5. [Test your connection](#test-your-connection)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

The project is created with a ready-to-use `neondb` database, which you will connect to.

## Create a Python project

1. Create a project directory and change to the newly created directory.

   ```shell
   mkdir neon-python-example
   cd neon-python-example
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment in this directory. The virtual environment isolates your project's Python environment (including installed packages) from the rest of your system.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment. When the virtual environment is activated, Python uses the environment's version of Python and any installed packages.

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the following dependencies in your project's root directory for synchronous and asynchronous code, respectively. You can install them using `pip`:

   <CodeTabs labels={["synchronous", "asynchronous"]}>

   ```bash
   pip install psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
   ```

   ```bash
   pip install asyncpg python-dotenv
   ```

   </CodeTabs>

## Store your Neon credentials

Add a `.env` file to your project's root directory and add your Neon connection string to it.

You can find the connection details for your database by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

Your connection string will look something like this:

```shell shouldWrap
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require
```

## Configure your python script

Add a `neon-connect.py` file to your project's root directory and add the following code. The script connects to your Neon database and retrieves the current time and Postgres version.

<CodeTabs labels={["synchronous", "asynchronous"]}>

```python
import os
from psycopg2 import pool
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load .env file
load_dotenv()

# Get the connection string from the environment variable
connection_string = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')

# Create a connection pool
connection_pool = pool.SimpleConnectionPool(
    1,  # Minimum number of connections in the pool
    10,  # Maximum number of connections in the pool
    connection_string
)

# Check if the pool was created successfully
if connection_pool:
    print("Connection pool created successfully")

# Get a connection from the pool
conn = connection_pool.getconn()

# Create a cursor object
cur = conn.cursor()

# Execute SQL commands to retrieve the current time and version from PostgreSQL
cur.execute('SELECT NOW();')
time = cur.fetchone()[0]

cur.execute('SELECT version();')
version = cur.fetchone()[0]

# Close the cursor and return the connection to the pool
cur.close()
connection_pool.putconn(conn)

# Close all connections in the pool
connection_pool.closeall()

# Print the results
print('Current time:', time)
print('PostgreSQL version:', version)
```

```python
import os
import asyncio
import asyncpg
from dotenv import load_dotenv

async def main():
    # Load .env file
    load_dotenv()

    # Get the connection string from the environment variable
    connection_string = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')

    # Create a connection pool
    pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(connection_string)

    # Acquire a connection from the pool
    async with pool.acquire() as conn:
        # Execute SQL commands to retrieve the current time and version from PostgreSQL
        time = await conn.fetchval('SELECT NOW();')
        version = await conn.fetchval('SELECT version();')

    # Close the pool
    await pool.close()

    # Print the results
    print('Current time:', time)
    print('PostgreSQL version:', version)

# Run the asynchronous main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeTabs>

## Test your connection

Run the `neon-connect.py` script to test your connection.

```shell
python3 neon-connect.py
```

If the connection is successful, the script returns information similar to the following:

```bash shouldWrap
Current time: 2023-05-24 08:53:10.403140+00:00
PostgreSQL version: PostgreSQL 15.2 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, 64-bit
```
