This page provides a comprehensive reference for all metrics and log fields that Neon exports to observability platforms through integrations like [Datadog](/docs/guides/datadog), [Grafana Cloud](/docs/guides/grafana-cloud), and [OpenTelemetry](/docs/guides/opentelemetry).

## Available metrics

Neon makes the following metrics available for export to third parties through our observability integrations.

All metrics include the following labels:

- `project_id`
- `endpoint_id`
- `compute_id`
- `job`

Here's an example of the metric `db_total_size` with all labels:

```json shouldWrap
neon_db_total_size{project_id="square-daffodil-12345678", endpoint_id="ep-aged-art-260862", compute_id="compute-shrill-blaze-b4hry7fg", job="sql-metrics"} 10485760
```

<Admonition type="note">
In Datadog, metric labels are referred to as `tags.` See [Getting Started with Tags](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/) in the Datadog Docs.

## Postgres logs

Neon can export Postgres logs to observability platforms, providing visibility into database activity, errors, and performance. These logs include:

- Error messages and warnings
- Connection events
- System notifications

### Log fields and metadata

Logs include the following labels and metadata for filtering and organization:

- `project_id`
- `endpoint_id`
- Timestamp
- Log level
- And other standard PostgreSQL log fields

<Admonition type="note">
During the beta phase, you may see some Neon-specific system logs included. These will be filtered out before general availability (GA).
</Admonition>

### Performance considerations

Enabling log export may result in:

- An increase in compute resource usage for log processing
- Additional network egress for log transmission (Neon does not charge for data transfer on paid plans)
- Associated costs based on log volume in your observability platform

<Admonition type="note">
Neon computes only send logs and metrics when they are active. If the [Scale to Zero](/docs/introduction/scale-to-zero) feature is enabled and a compute is suspended due to inactivity, no logs or metrics will be sent during the suspension. This may result in gaps in your data.

Additionally, if you are setting up an integration for a project with an inactive compute, you'll need to activate the compute before it can send data. To activate it, simply run a query from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or any connected client.
</Admonition>

### Technical details

Neon processes logs directly on each compute instance using [rsyslogd](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/index.html), an industry-standard open source logging utility. This compute-level processing means that log collection contributes to your compute's resource usage.
