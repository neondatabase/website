## INFO: Resource is locked. Waiting 3000ms before retrying...

    This error occurs when you attempt to perform an operation that accesses a resource that is currently locked. The operation will be retried up to 5 times at the specified interval. For example, a project creation operation may be in progress, preventing other operations from runnign on the project until the project creation operation is finished.

    Wait until the operation completes before executing and additional operation on the locked resource. If necessary, you can poll for operation status using the [neon operations list](/docs/reference/cli-operations) command.
