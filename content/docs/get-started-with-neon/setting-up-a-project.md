To create your first project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select **Create a project**.

   ![Create a project](/docs/get-started-with-neon/create_project.png)

3. On the **Project Creation** dialog, specify a name, a Postgres version, and a region. If you are a [Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) user, you can also specify compute size settings (not shown below). Neon supports larger compute sizes and Autoscaling (beta). For more information about these options, see [Compute size and Autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).
