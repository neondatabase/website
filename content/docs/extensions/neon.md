The `neon` extension provides functions and views designed to gather Neon-specific metrics.

- [The `neon_stat_file_cache` view](#the-neon_stat_file_cache-view)
- [Views for Neon internal use](#views-for-neon-internal-use)

## The neon_stat_file_cache view

The `neon_stat_file_cache` view provides insights into how effectively your Neon compute's Local File Cache (LFC) is being used.

## What is the Local File Cache?

Neon computes have a Local File Cache (LFC), which is a layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data in the local memory of the Neon compute. Like Postgres [shared buffers](/docs/reference/glossary#shared-buffers), the LFC reduces latency and improves query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from Neon storage. The LFC acts as an add-on or extension of Postgres shared buffers. In Neon computes, the `shared_buffers` parameter is always set to 128 MB, regardless of compute size. The LFC extends the cache memory to approximately 80% of your compute's RAM. To view the LFC size for each Neon compute size, see [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

When data is requested, Postgres checks shared buffers first, then the LFC. If the requested data is not found in the LFC, it is read from Neon storage. Shared buffers and the LFC both cache your most recently accessed data, but they may not cache exactly the same data due to different cache eviction patterns. The LFC is also much larger than shared buffers, so it stores significantly more data.

## Monitoring Local File Cache usage

You can monitor Local File Cache usage by installing the `neon` extension on your database and querying the [neon_stat_file_cache](/docs/) view or by monitoring the [Local file cache hit rate](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page) graph on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon console.

## neon_stat_file_cache view

The `neon_stat_file_cache` view includes the following metrics:

- `file_cache_misses`: The number of times the requested page block is not found in Postgres shared buffers or the LFC. In this case, the page block is retrieved from Neon storage.
- `file_cache_hits`: The number of times the requested page block was not found in Postgres shared buffers but was found in the LFC.
- `file_cache_used`: The number of times the LFC was accessed.
- `file_cache_writes`: The number of writes to the LFC. A write occurs when a requested page block is not found in Postgres shared buffers or the LFC. In this case, the data is retrieved from Neon storage and then written to shared buffers and the LFC.
- `file_cache_hit_ratio`: The percentage of database requests that are served from the LFC rather than Neon storage. This is a measure of cache efficiency, indicating how often requested data is found in the cache. A higher cache hit ratio suggests better performance, as accessing data from memory is faster than accessing data from storage. The ratio is calculated using the following formula:

  ```
  file_cache_hit_ratio = (file_cache_hits / (file_cache_hits + file_cache_misses)) * 100
  ```

  For OLTP workloads, you should aim for a cache hit ratio of 99% or better. However, the ideal cache hit ratio depends on your specific workload and data access patterns. In some cases, a slightly lower ratio might still be acceptable, especially if the workload involves a lot of sequential scanning of large tables where caching might be less effective. If you find that your cache hit ration is quite low, your working set may not be fully or adequately in memory. In this case, consider using a larger compute with more memory. Please keep in mind that the statistics are for the entire compute, not specific databases or tables.

### Using the neon_stat_file_cache view

To use the `neon_stat_file_cache` view, install the `neon` extension on your database:

To install the extension on a database:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION neon;
```

To connect to your database. You can find a connection string for yoru database on the Neon Dashboard.

```bash shouldWrap
psql postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

If you are already connected via `psql`, you can simply switch to the `postgres` database using the `\c` command:

```shell
\c dbname
```

Issue the following query to view LFC usage data for your compute:

```sql
SELECT * FROM neon_stat_file_cache;
 file_cache_misses | file_cache_hits | file_cache_used | file_cache_writes | file_cache_hit_ratio
-------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------
           2133643 |       108999742 |             607 |          10767410 |                98.08
```

<Admonition type="note">
Local File Cache statistics represent the lifetime of your compute, from the last time the compute started until the time you ran the query. Be aware that statistics are lost when your compute stops and gathered again from scratch when your compute restarts. You'll only want to run the cache hit ratio query after a representative workload has been run. For example, say that you increased your compute size after seeing a cache hit ratio below 99%. Changing the compute size restarts your compute, so you lose all of your current usage statistics. In this case, you should run your workload before you try the cache hit ratio query again to see if your cache hit ratio improved.

Remember that Postgres checks shared buffers first before it checks your compute's Local File Cache. If you are only working with a small amount of data, queries may be served entirely from the shared buffers, resulting in no LFC hits.

## View LFC metrics with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

You can also use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with the `FILECACHE` option to view LFC cache hit and miss data. Installing the `noen` extension is not required. For example:

```sql {6,12,16,22}
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE,BUFFERS,PREFETCH,FILECACHE) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pgbench_accounts;

 Finalize Aggregate  (cost=214486.94..214486.95 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=5195.378..5196.034 rows=1 loops=1)

   Prefetch: hits=0 misses=1865 expired=0 duplicates=0
   File cache: hits=141826 misses=1865
   ->  Gather  (cost=214486.73..214486.94 rows=2 width=8) (actual time=5195.366..5196.025 rows=3 loops=1)

                     File cache: hits=141826 misses=1865
```

## Views for Neon internal use

The `neon` extension is installed by default to a system-owned `postgres` database in each Neon project. The `postgres` database includes functions and views owned by the Neon system role (`cloud_admin`) that are used to collect statistics. This data helps the Neon team enhance the Neon service.
