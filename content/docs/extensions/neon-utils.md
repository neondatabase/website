The `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function you can use to monitor how Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature allocates vCPU in response to workload. The function returns the current number of allocated vCPUs.

For information about Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

## Install the `neon_utils` extension

Install the `neon_utils` extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION neon_utils;
```

For information about using the Neon **SQL Editor**, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Use the `num_cpus()` function

In Neon, computing capacity is measured in _Compute Units (CU)_. One CU is 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, 2 CU is 2 vCPU and 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the number of vCPU. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 to 56 CU, but _Autoscaling_ is only supported up to 16 CU.

Defining a minimum and maximum compute size for your compute, as shown below, enables autoscaling.

![Edit compute dialog showing an autoscaling configuration](/docs/extensions/edit_compute_endpoint.png)

As your workload changes, computing capacity scales dynamically between the minimum and maximum settings defined in your compute configuration. To retrieve the number of allocated vCPU at any point in time, you can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT num_cpus();
```

For autoscaling configuration instructions, see [Compute size and autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply:

- The `num_cpus()` function does not return fractional vCPU sizes. The _Autoscaling_ feature can scale by fractional vCPU, but the `num_cpus()` function reports the next whole number. For example, if the current number of allocated vCPU is `.25` or `.5`, the `num_cpus()` function returns `1`.
- The `num_cpus()` function only works on computes that have the _Autoscaling_ feature enabled. Running the function on a fixed-size compute does not return a correct value.

## Observe autoscaling with `neon_utils` and `pgbench`

The following instructions demonstrate how you can use the `num_cpus()` function with `pgbench` to observe how Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature responds to workload.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that autoscaling is enabled for your compute. For instructions, see [Compute size and autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration). The following example uses a minimum setting of 0.25 Compute Units (CU) and a maximum of 4.
- The [pgbench](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html) utility.

### Run the test

1. Install the `neon_utils` extension:

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS neon_utils;
   ```

2. Create a `test.sql` file with the following queries:

   ```sql
   SELECT LOG(factorial(5000)) / LOG(factorial(2500));
   SELECT txid_current();
   ```

3. To avoid errors when running `pgbench`, initialize your database with the tables used by `pgbench`. This can be done using the `pgbench -i` command, specifying the connection string for your Neon database. You can obtain a connection string by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard** to open the **Connect to your database** modal.

   ```bash shouldWrap
   pgbench -i postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

4. Run a `pgbench` test with your `test.sql` file, specifying your connection string:

   ```bash shouldWrap
   pgbench -f test.sql -c 15 -T 1000 -P 1 postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

   The test produces output similar to the following on a compute set to scale from 0.25 to 4 CUs.

   ```bash
   pgbench (15.3)
   starting vacuum...end.

5. Call the `num_cpus()` function to retrieve the current number of allocated vCPU.

   ```sql
   ​​neondb=> SELECT num_cpus();
   num_cpus
   ----------
           4
   (1 row)
   ```
