In order to launch Neon projects, you need to sign up on <https://console.neon.tech> and click on the New Project button.

A Neon Project will automatically spin up compute, and you will be able to query it with the SQL Editor, psql, or from your application.

All the operations that are available to you in the web UI are also available via API. In order to use the API, you will need to generate a token in the Settings of the console.
