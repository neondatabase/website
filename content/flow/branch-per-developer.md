In traditional workflows, developers often share a staging or development database, leading to conflicting changes, overwritten test data, and hard-to-reproduce bugs. With Neon, each developer can work in a fully isolated environment by branching off a shared, production-like template such as `main-dev` or `main-anon`.

For example, a developer named Arjun might create a branch called `dev-arjun`. This branch has the full schema and data of the parent but is completely isolated. Any schema changes or debugging work happen independently, without affecting anyone else.
