There’s no single right way to use Neon branching. Your architecture will depend on where your production data lives, whether you need to handle PII, and how your team works.

For teams used to traditional server-based databases (managing long-lived instances, duplicating environments manually, or maintaining seed scripts) branching requires a shift in mindset. But once you experience the flexibility of on-demand, ephemeral environments, you won’t go back.

This section outlines common branching strategies based on real-world patterns. Navigate to the scenario that most resembles your use case.
