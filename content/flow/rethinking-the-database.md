subtitle: "Discover how Neon's branching model transforms database workflows with instant, ephemeral environments"

Neon replaces these outdated workflows with a more powerful model: ephemeral, on-demand environments backed by database branching.

Instead of creating and managing separate database instances for every task, teams work from a single source of truth (a production-like parent branch) and create lightweight, fully functional clones for development, testing, and preview workflows.

The result: faster development cycles, safer experimentation, and simpler infrastructure management.

<Testimonial
text="Developers already face significant delays when working on a PR — running CI tests, ensuring everything is ready for preview, it all adds up. Time to launch is crucial for us: when we tried Neon and saw that spinning up a new branch takes seconds, we were blown away."
