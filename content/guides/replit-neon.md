### Describe your app

In the chat interface, describe your app idea to Replit Agent in as much detail as possible. For example, you can say:

```text shouldWrap
Create an AI application that generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from uploaded PDFs for students to prepare for exams, using OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model. It should have the following features:

- Ability to upload PDF documents.
- Generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model.
- MCQs directly based on the content of the uploaded PDF.
- Functionality to create and share a link to the generated MCQs
```

Click "Start Building" to initiate the app creation process.

### Review and approve the agent generated plan

Replit Agent will present a development plan, outlining the proposed architecture and features for your application. Carefully review this plan, which details the intended technologies, functionalities, and implementation steps.

Click "Approve Plan & Start" to authorize Replit Agent to proceed with the application build process based on the outlined plan.

### Watch Replit Agent in action

You can now observe Replit Agent as it autonomously generates the application code, creating files within the project explorer and generating code in the editor window in real-time. Agent manages both frontend and backend code generation. You can sit back and watch as the application structure takes shape ðŸ˜Ž

<Admonition type="note" title="Iterating with Replit Agent">
Developing applications with AI Agents is inherently an iterative process. As you work with evolving libraries and configurations, occasional unexpected behavior is to be anticipated.  When issues occur, **refer to the video above to see a practical example of iterative debugging.**  Proactively engage Replit Agent by describing the specific problem â€“ detail what you observed, your intended functionality, and any error messages. Replit Agent will then provide guidance and code modifications to address the issue.

### Run the generated application

Upon completion of the initial code generation phase, Replit Agent will automatically launch your application within the Replit webview. This allows you to interact with the initial MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) Generator.

### Debugging and iterative refinement with Replit Agent

Software development often involves debugging, and Replit Agent is designed to assist in this process. As demonstrated in the video, encountering errors is a normal part of development, and Agent can help diagnose and resolve them.

Should you encounter an error, **carefully examine the error message** displayed in the Replit webview or the console. **Copy the full error message and paste it directly into the Replit Agent chat window.**

Replit Agent is trained to interpret error messages and suggest corrective actions. It will analyze the provided error information, identify the root cause, and propose code modifications to rectify the issue. In our case, Agent accurately identified and resolved a `pdf.js` library error, providing specific code changes.

    ![Replit Agent PDF.js error](/docs/guides/replit-agent-pdfjs-error.png)

Review the Agent's proposed solution and watch as it implements the necessary code modifications. This iterative process of debugging and refinement is a key aspect of developing applications with Replit Agent.

### Add OpenAI API key

To enable the AI-powered MCQ generation, you must integrate your OpenAI API key into the generated application. Replit Agent will prompt you to add this key to integrate with OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model.

    ![Replit Agent OpenAI API key prompt](/docs/guides/replit-agent-openai-key.png)

### Validate MCQ generation functionality

With the OpenAI API key integrated, test the core application feature: generating MCQs from uploaded PDF documents. Upload a sample PDF file to the application and observe the MCQ generation process.

    ![Replit Agent Test app](/docs/guides/replit-agent-test-app.png)

### Review, verify, and share generated MCQs

Examine the generated MCQs, assessing their relevance, accuracy, and overall quality based on the source PDF document. Test the generated shareable link by opening it in a new browser session. This link should direct users to the generated MCQs, enabling them to review and attempt the quiz.

    ![Replit Agent Share Quiz](/docs/guides/replit-agent-share-quiz.png)

### Database integration

A quick review of the generated code will reveal that Replit Agent has defaulted to an in-memory database for simplicity. To confirm this, you can directly ask the Agent about data storage. While in-memory databases are suitable for initial development, they are not ideal for production applications where data persistence is crucial. For a production-grade application, integrating a persistent database like Postgres is essential. You can now instruct Replit Agent to switch your application's data layer to a fully managed Postgres, powered by Neon. Replit Agent will make the necessary changes to the application code to integrate the Postgres database.
