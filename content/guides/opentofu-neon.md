[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org) is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, forked from Terraform, that allows you to define and provision cloud resources in a declarative configuration language. By codifying infrastructure, OpenTofu enables consistent, repeatable, and automated deployments, significantly reducing manual errors. It is a community-driven alternative governed by the Linux Foundation.

This guide will show you how to use **OpenTofu to manage your Neon projects**, including your branches, databases, and compute endpoints. By using OpenTofu with Neon, you get better control, can track changes, and automate your database setup.

Neon can be managed using the following community-developed Terraform provider, which is compatible with OpenTofu:

**Terraform Provider Neon - Maintainer: Dmitry Kisler**

## Provider usage notes

- **Provider upgrades**: When using `tofu init -upgrade` to update a provider, be aware that changes in the provider’s schema or defaults can lead to unintended resource replacements. This may occur when certain attributes are altered or reset.

  To avoid unintended resource replacements which can result in data loss:
  - Review the provider’s changelog for any breaking changes that might affect your resources before upgrading to a new version.
  - For CI pipelines and auto-approved pull requests, only use `tofu init`. Running `tofu init -upgrade` should be done manually followed by plan reviews.
  - Run `tofu plan` before applying any changes to detect potential differences and review the behavior of resource updates.
  - Use [lifecycle protections](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle/) on critical resources to ensure they're not recreated unintentionally.
  - Explicitly define all critical resource parameters in your OpenTofu configurations, even if they had defaults previously.
  - On Neon paid plans, you can enable branch protection to prevent unintended deletion of branches and projects. To learn more, see [Protected branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches).

- **Provider maintenance**: As Neon enhances existing features and introduces new ones, the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) will continue to evolve. These changes may not immediately appear in community-maintained providers. If you notice that a provider requires an update, please reach out to the maintainer by opening an issue or contributing to the provider's GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **OpenTofu CLI installed:** If you don't have OpenTofu installed, download and install it from the [official OpenTofu website](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/).
2.  **Neon Account:** You'll need a Neon account. If you don't have one, sign up at [neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech/signup).
3.  **Neon API key:** Generate an API key from the Neon Console. Navigate to your Account Settings > API Keys. This key is required for the provider to authenticate with the Neon API. Learn more about creating API keys in [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

## Set up the OpenTofu Neon provider

1.  **Create a project directory:**
    Create a new directory for your OpenTofu project and navigate into it.

    ```shell
    mkdir neon-opentofu-project
    cd neon-opentofu-project
    ```

2.  **Create a `main.tf` file:**
    This file will contain your OpenTofu configuration. Start by declaring the required Neon provider. OpenTofu can use providers from the tofu registry.

    ```tofu
    tofu {
      required_providers {
        neon = {
          source  = "kislerdm/neon"
        }
      }
    }

    provider "neon" {}
    ```

3.  **Initialize OpenTofu:**
    Run the `tofu init` command in your project directory. This command downloads and installs the Neon provider.
    ```shell
    tofu init
    ```

## Configure authentication

The Neon provider needs your Neon API key to manage resources. You can configure it in two ways:

1.  **Directly in the provider block (Less secure):**
    For quick testing, you can **hardcode your API key** directly within `provider "neon"` block. However, this method isn't recommended for production environments or shared configurations. A more secure alternative is to retrieve the API key from a secrets management service like [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) or [HashiCorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault), and then update your provider block to reflect this.

    ```tofu
    provider "neon" {
      api_key = "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"
    }
    ```

2.  **Using environment variables:**
    The provider will automatically use the `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable if set.

    ```shell
    export NEON_API_KEY="<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"
    ```

    If the environment variable is set, you can leave the `provider "neon"` block empty:

    ```tofu
    provider "neon" {}
    ```

<Admonition type="note">
The following sections primarily detail the creation of Neon resources. To manage existing resources, use the `tofu import` command or `import` blocks. More information can be found in the [Import Existing Neon Resources](#import-existing-neon-resources-with-opentofu) section.

## Manage Neon resources with OpenTofu

This section provides examples of how to manage Neon resources using OpenTofu. You can create and manage projects, branches, endpoints, roles, databases, and more.

### Managing projects

A Neon project is the top-level container for your Postgres databases, branches, and endpoints.

```tofu
resource "neon_project" "my_app_project" {
  name       = "my-application-project"
  pg_version = 16
  region_id  = "aws-us-east-1"

  # Configure default branch settings (optional)
  branch {
    name          = "production"
    database_name = "app_db"
    role_name     = "app_admin"
  }

  # Configure default endpoint settings (optional)
  default_endpoint_settings {
    autoscaling_limit_min_cu = 0.25
    autoscaling_limit_max_cu = 1.0
    # suspend_timeout_seconds  = 300
  }
}
```

This configuration creates a new Neon project.

**Key `neon_project` attributes:**

- `name`: (Optional) Name of the project.
- `pg_version`: (Optional) PostgreSQL version (e.g., 14, 15, 16, 17).
- `region_id`: (Optional) The region where the project will be created (e.g., `aws-us-east-1`).
  > For up-to-date information on available regions, see [Neon Regions](/docs/introduction/regions).
- `branch {}`: (Optional) Block to configure the default primary branch.

**Output project details:**
You can output computed values like the project ID or connection URI:

```tofu
output "project_id" {
  value = neon_project.my_app_project.id
}

output "project_connection_uri" {
  description = "Default connection URI for the primary branch (contains credentials)."
  value       = neon_project.my_app_project.connection_uri
  sensitive   = true
}

output "project_default_branch_id" {
  value = neon_project.my_app_project.default_branch_id
}

output "project_database_user" {
  value = neon_project.my_app_project.database_user
}
```

For more attributes and options on managing projects, refer to the [Provider's documentation](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/blob/master/docs/resources/project.md).

### Managing branches

You can create branches from the primary branch or any other existing branch.

```tofu
resource "neon_branch" "dev_branch" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  name       = "feature-x-development"
  parent_id  = neon_project.my_app_project.default_branch_id # Branch from the project's primary branch

  # Optional: Create a protected branch
  # protected = "yes"

  # Optional: Create from a specific LSN or timestamp of the parent
  # parent_lsn = "..."
  # parent_timestamp = 1678886400 # Unix epoch
}
```

**Key `neon_branch` attributes:**

- `project_id`: (Required) ID of the parent project.
- `name`: (Optional) Name for the new branch.
- `parent_id`: (Optional) ID of the parent branch. If not specified, defaults to the project's primary branch.
- `protected`: (Optional, String: "yes" or "no") Set to protect the branch.
- `parent_lsn`: (Optional) LSN of the parent branch to create from.
- `parent_timestamp`: (Optional) Timestamp of the parent branch to create from.

> `protected` attribute is only available for paid plans. It allows you to protect branches from deletion or modification.

For more attributes and options on managing branches, refer to the [Provider's documentation](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/blob/master/docs/resources/branch.md).

### Managing endpoints

Endpoints provide connection strings to access your branches. Each branch can have multiple read-only endpoints but only one read-write endpoint.

Before creating an endpoint, you must first create a **branch** for it to connect to. Here's how to create a read-write endpoint for your `dev_branch`:

```tofu
resource "neon_endpoint" "dev_endpoint" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.dev_branch.id
  type       = "read_write" # "read_write" or "read_only"

  autoscaling_limit_min_cu = 0.25
  autoscaling_limit_max_cu = 0.5
  # suspend_timeout_seconds  = 600

  # Optional: Enable connection pooling
  # pooler_enabled = true
}

output "dev_endpoint_host" {
  value = neon_endpoint.dev_endpoint.host
}
```

**Key `neon_endpoint` attributes:**

- `project_id`: (Required) ID of the parent project.
- `branch_id`: (Required) ID of the branch this endpoint connects to.
- `type`: (Optional) `read_write` (default) or `read_only`. A branch can only have one `read_write` endpoint.
- `autoscaling_limit_min_cu`/`autoscaling_limit_max_cu`: (Optional) Compute units for autoscaling.
- `suspend_timeout_seconds`: (Optional) Inactivity period before suspension. Only available for paid plans.
- `pooler_enabled`: (Optional) Enable connection pooling.

<Admonition type="note">
It is not possible currently to change the endpoint type after creation. The `type` attribute is immutable, meaning you cannot modify it once the endpoint is created. This includes changing from `read_write` to `read_only` or vice versa. This is a limitation of the Neon API and the provider's current implementation. You must destroy the existing endpoint and create a new one with the desired type.
</Admonition>

For more attributes and options on managing endpoints, refer to the [Provider's documentation](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/blob/master/docs/resources/endpoint.md)

### Managing roles

Roles (users) are managed per branch. Before creating a role, ensure you have a branch created. Follow the [Managing Branches](#managing-branches) section for details.

```tofu
resource "neon_role" "app_user" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.dev_branch.id
  name       = "application_user"
}

output "app_user_password" {
  value     = neon_role.app_user.password
  sensitive = true
}
```

**Key `neon_role` attributes:**

- `project_id`: (Required) ID of the parent project.
- `branch_id`: (Required) ID of the branch for this role.
- `name`: (Required) Name of the role.
- `password`: (Computed, Sensitive) The generated password for the role.

For more attributes and options on managing roles, refer to the [Provider's documentation](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/blob/master/docs/resources/role.md)

### Managing databases

Databases are also managed per branch. Follow the [Managing Branches](#managing-branches) section for details on creating a branch.

```tofu
resource "neon_database" "service_db" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.dev_branch.id
  name       = "service_specific_database"
  owner_name = neon_role.app_user.name
}
```

**Key `neon_database` attributes:**

- `project_id`: (Required) ID of the parent project.
- `branch_id`: (Required) ID of the branch for this database.
- `name`: (Required) Name of the database.
- `owner_name`: (Required) Name of the role that will own this database.

For more attributes and options on managing databases, refer to the [Provider's documentation](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/blob/master/docs/resources/database.md)

### Managing API keys

You can manage Neon API keys themselves using OpenTofu.

```tofu
resource "neon_api_key" "ci_cd_key" {
  name = "automation-key-for-ci"
}

output "ci_cd_api_key_value" {
  description = "The actual API key token."
  value       = neon_api_key.ci_cd_key.key
  sensitive   = true
}
```

**Key `neon_api_key` attributes:**

- `name`: (Required) A descriptive name for the API key.
- `key`: (Computed, Sensitive) The generated API key token.

### Advanced: Project permissions

Share project access with other users.

```tofu
resource "neon_project_permission" "share_with_colleague" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  grantee    = "colleague@example.com"
}
```

### Advanced: JWKS URL for RLS

Configure JWKS URL for Row Level Security authorization.

```tofu
resource "neon_jwks_url" "auth_provider_jwks" {
  project_id    = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  # Use the default role from the project, or specify custom roles
  role_names    = [neon_project.my_app_project.database_user]
  provider_name = "YourAuthProviderName" # e.g., "clerk"
  jwks_url      = "<https://<YOUR_AUTH_PROVIDER_JWKS_URL>" # Replace with your actual JWKS URL
}
```

> For a list of supported providers, see [Neon RLS: Supported Providers](/docs/guides/neon-rls#supported-providers).

For more attributes and options on managing JWKS URLs, refer to the [Provider's documentation](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/blob/master/docs/resources/jwks_url.md)

### Advanced: VPC endpoint management (for Neon private networking)

These resources are used for organizations with Scale or Enterprise plans requiring private networking.

#### Assign VPC endpoint to organization

```tofu
resource "neon_vpc_endpoint_assignment" "org_vpc_endpoint" {
  org_id          = "your-neon-organization-id" # Replace with your actual Org ID
  region_id       = "aws-us-east-1"             # Neon region ID
  vpc_endpoint_id = "vpce-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"    # Your AWS VPC Endpoint ID
  label           = "main-aws-vpc-endpoint"
}
```

For more attributes and options on managing VPC endpoints, refer to the [Provider's documentation](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/blob/master/docs/resources/vpc_endpoint_assignment.md)

#### Restrict project to VPC endpoint

```tofu
resource "neon_vpc_endpoint_restriction" "project_to_vpc" {
  project_id      = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  vpc_endpoint_id = neon_vpc_endpoint_assignment.org_vpc_endpoint.vpc_endpoint_id
  label           = "restrict-my-app-project-to-vpc"
}
```

For more attributes and options on managing VPC endpoint restrictions, refer to the [Provider's documentation](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/blob/master/docs/resources/vpc_endpoint_restriction.md)

## Apply the configuration with OpenTofu

Once you have defined your resources:

1.  **Format and validate:**

    ```shell
    tofu fmt
    tofu validate
    ```

2.  **Plan:**
    Run `tofu plan` to see what actions OpenTofu will take.

    ```shell
    tofu plan -out=tfplan
    ```

3.  **Apply:**
    Run `tofu apply` to create the resources in Neon.
    ```shell
    tofu apply tfplan
    ```
    OpenTofu will ask for confirmation. Type `yes` to confirm.

You have now successfully created and managed Neon resources using OpenTofu! You can continue to modify your `main.tf` file to add, change, or remove resources as needed. After making changes, repeat the `tofu plan` and `tofu apply` steps to update your resources on Neon.

## Import existing Neon resources with OpenTofu

If you have existing Neon resources that were created outside of OpenTofu (e.g., via the Neon Console or API directly), you can bring them under OpenTofu's management. This allows you to manage their lifecycle with code moving forward. OpenTofu supports both the CLI import command and declarative import blocks, similar to tofu 1.5.0+.

Both methods involve telling OpenTofu about an existing resource and associating it with a `resource` block in your configuration.

### Set up your OpenTofu configuration for import

Ensure your OpenTofu environment is configured for the Neon provider as described previously:

1.  Define the provider in your `main.tf`.
2.  Run `tofu init`.
3.  Configure authentication for the Neon provider.

### Neon resource IDs for import

When importing Neon resources, you need to know the specific ID format for each resource type. Always refer to the "Import" section of the specific resource's documentation page on the [Provider's GitHub: `kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon`](https://github.com/kislerdm/terraform-provider-neon/tree/master/docs/resources) for the exact ID format.

Common formats:

- **`neon_project`:** Project ID (e.g., `my-application-project-tofu-actual-id`).
- **`neon_branch`:** Branch ID (e.g., `br-dev-branch-tofu-actual-id`).
- **`neon_endpoint`:** Endpoint ID (e.g., `ep-dev-endpoint-tofu-actual-id`).
- **`neon_role`:** Composite ID: `<project_id>/<branch_id>/<role_name>`.
- **`neon_database`:** Composite ID: `<project_id>/<branch_id>/<database_name>`.
- **`neon_api_key` and `neon_jwks_url`:** These do not support import.

### Order of import for dependent resources

When importing resources that depend on each other, it's important to import them in the order of their dependencies:

```plaintext
Project -> Branch -> Endpoint -> Role -> Database
```

### Method 1: Using the `tofu import` CLI command

For each Neon resource you want to import:

1.  **Write a resource block:** Add a corresponding minimal `resource` block to your OpenTofu configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`).
2.  **Run `tofu import`:** Execute the import command: `tofu import <tofu_resource_address> <neon_resource_id>`.

#### Example: Importing resources using `tofu import` CLI

In this example, we'll import the resources we defined earlier in the [Manage Neon Resources](#manage-neon-resources-with-opentofu) section. This needs a project, a branch, an endpoint, a role, and a database already created in your Neon account. These resources will now be imported into a new OpenTofu configuration.

##### Define the HCL resource blocks

In your `main.tf` file, define the resource blocks for the existing resources. You can start with minimal definitions, as OpenTofu will populate the actual values during the import process. You primarily need to define the resource type and a name for OpenTofu to use. OpenTofu will populate the actual attribute values from the live resource into its state file during the import. You'll then use `tofu plan` to see these and update your HCL to match or to define your desired state.

For required attributes (like `project_id` for a branch), you'll either need to hardcode the known ID or reference a resource that will also be imported.

```tofu
tofu {
  required_providers {
    neon = {
      source  = "kislerdm/neon"
    }
  }
}

provider "neon" {}

# --- Project ---
resource "neon_project" "my_app_project" {}

# --- Development Branch ---
# Requires project_id. We'll reference the project we're about to import.
# The actual value of neon_project.my_app_project.id will be known after its import.
resource "neon_branch" "dev_branch" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  name       = "feature-x-development"
}

# --- Development Branch Endpoint ---
# Requires project_id and branch_id.
resource "neon_endpoint" "dev_endpoint" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.dev_branch.id
}

# --- Application User Role on Development Branch ---
# Requires project_id, branch_id, and name.
resource "neon_role" "app_user" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.dev_branch.id
  name       = "application_user"
}

# --- Service Database on Development Branch ---
# Requires project_id, branch_id, name, and owner_name.
resource "neon_database" "service_db" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.dev_branch.id
  name       = "service_specific_database"
  owner_name = neon_role.app_user.name
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the minimal HCL and why certain attributes are included:

- **`neon_project.my_app_project`**:
  - This block defines the OpenTofu resource for your main Neon project.
  - No attributes are strictly required _in the HCL_ for the import command itself, as the project is imported using its unique Neon Project ID. Adding a `name` attribute matching the existing project can aid readability but isn't essential for the import operation.

- **`neon_branch.dev_branch`**:
  - This defines the OpenTofu resource for your development branch.
  - It requires `project_id` in the HCL to link it to the (to-be-imported) project resource within OpenTofu.
  - The `name` attribute should also be specified in the HCL, matching the existing branch's name, as it's a key identifier.
  - The branch is imported using its unique Neon Branch ID.

- **`neon_endpoint.dev_endpoint`**:
  - This block defines the OpenTofu resource for the endpoint on your development branch.
  - It requires both `project_id` and `branch_id` in the HCL to correctly associate it with the imported project and development branch resources within OpenTofu.
  - Other attributes like `type` (which defaults if unspecified) or autoscaling limits will be read from the live resource during import.
  - The endpoint is imported using its unique Neon Endpoint ID.

- **`neon_role.app_user`**:
  - This defines the OpenTofu resource for an application user role.
  - The HCL requires `project_id` and `branch_id` to link to the respective imported OpenTofu resources.
  - The `name` attribute must be specified in the HCL and match the existing role's name.

- **`neon_database.service_db`**:
  - This defines the OpenTofu resource for a service-specific database.
  - The HCL requires `project_id` and `branch_id` to link to the imported OpenTofu resources.
  - The `name` attribute must be specified in the HCL and match the existing database's name.
  - The `owner_name` should also be included, linking to the OpenTofu role resource (e.g., `neon_role.app_user.name`) that owns this database.

All other configurable attributes will be populated into OpenTofu's state file from the live Neon resource during the `tofu import` process. You will then refine your HCL by reviewing the `tofu plan` output.

#### Run the import commands in order

1.  **Import the project:**

    ```shell
    tofu import neon_project.my_app_project "actual_project_id_from_neon"
    ```

    You can retrieve the project ID via Neon Console/CLI/API. Learn more: [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects#project-settings)

    Import successful!

    The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
    your OpenTofu state and will henceforth be managed by OpenTofu.
    ```

5.  **Import the service database:**

    ```shell
    tofu import neon_database.service_db "actual_project_id_from_neon/actual_dev_branch_id_from_neon/service_specific_database"
    ```

    > Replace `service_specific_database` with the actual name of the database you want to import.

    Example output:

    ```shell
    tofu import neon_database.service_db "damp-recipe-88779456/br-orange-bonus-a4v00wjl/service_specific_database"
    ```

    ```text
    neon_database.service_db: Importing from ID "damp-recipe-88779456/br-orange-bonus-a4v00wjl/service_specific_database"...
    neon_database.service_db: Import prepared!
      Prepared neon_database for import
    neon_database.service_db: Refreshing state... [id=damp-recipe-88779456/br-orange-bonus-a4v00wjl/service_specific_database]

    Import successful!

    The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
    your OpenTofu state and will henceforth be managed by OpenTofu.
    ```

    After importing all resources, your OpenTofu state file (`terraform.tfstate`) will now contain the imported resources, and you can manage them using OpenTofu. Follow the [Reconcile your HCL with the imported state](#reconcile-your-hcl-with-the-imported-state) section to update your HCL files with the attributes that were populated during the import.

### Method 2: Using `import` Blocks

OpenTofu also supports a declarative way to import existing resources using `import` blocks in your `.tf` files. This method is similar to the `tofu import` command but allows you to define the import process directly in your configuration file.

**The process with `import` Blocks:**

For each existing Neon resource you want to bring under OpenTofu management, you'll define two blocks in your `.tf` file:

- A standard `resource "resource_type" "resource_name" {}` block. For the initial import, this block can be minimal. It primarily tells OpenTofu the type and name of the resource in your configuration.
- An `import {}` block:
  - `to = resource_type.resource_name`: This refers to the OpenTofu address of the `resource` block you defined above.
  - `id = "neon_specific_id"`: This is the actual ID of the resource as it exists in Neon (e.g., project ID, branch ID, or composite ID for roles/databases).

**Example using `import` blocks:**

In this example, we'll import the resources we defined earlier in the [Manage Neon Resources](#manage-neon-resources-with-opentofu) section. This needs a project, a branch, an endpoint, a role, and a database already created in your Neon account. These resources will now be imported into a new OpenTofu configuration.

Let's say we have the following existing Neon resources and their IDs:

- Project `my_app_project` ID: `damp-recipe-88779456`
- Branch `dev_branch` ID: `br-orange-bonus-a4v00wjl`
- Endpoint `dev_endpoint` ID: `ep-blue-cell-a4xzunwf`
- Role `application_user`
- Database `service_specific_database`

You would add the following to your `main.tf`:

```tofu
tofu {
  required_providers {
    neon = {
      source  = "kislerdm/neon"
    }
  }
}

provider "neon" {
  # API key configured via environment variable or directly
}

# --- Project Import ---
import {
  to = neon_project.my_app_project
  id = "damp-recipe-88779456" # Replace with your actual Project ID
}

resource "neon_project" "my_app_project" {
  # Minimal definition for import.
  # After import and plan, you'll populate this with actual/desired attributes.
}

# --- Development Branch Import ---
import {
  to = neon_branch.dev_branch
  id = "br-orange-bonus-a4v00wjl" # Replace with your actual Branch ID
}

resource "neon_branch" "dev_branch" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id # Links to the TF resource
  name       = "feature-x-development"        # Should match existing branch name
}

# --- Development Branch Endpoint Import ---
import {
  to = neon_endpoint.dev_endpoint
  id = "ep-blue-cell-a4xzunwf" # Replace with your actual Endpoint ID
}

resource "neon_endpoint" "dev_endpoint" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.dev_branch.id      # Links to the TF resource
}

# --- Application User Role on Development Branch Import ---
import {
  to = neon_role.app_user
  # ID format: project_id/branch_id/role_name
  id = "damp-recipe-88779456/br-orange-bonus-a4v00wjl/application_user"
}

resource "neon_role" "app_user" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.dev_branch.id
  name       = "application_user"             # Must match existing role name
}

# --- Service Database on Development Branch Import ---
import {
  to = neon_database.service_db
  # ID format: project_id/branch_id/name
  id = "damp-recipe-88779456/br-orange-bonus-a4v00wjl/service_specific_database"
}

resource "neon_database" "service_db" {
  project_id = neon_project.my_app_project.id
  branch_id  = neon_branch.dev_branch.id
  name       = "service_specific_database"    # Must match existing database name
  owner_name = neon_role.app_user.name        # Links to the TF role resource
}
```

<Admonition type="important">
You need to replace the IDs in the `import` blocks with the actual IDs of your existing Neon resources. The `to` field in each `import` block refers to the corresponding `resource` block defined in your configuration. The above configuration is a minimal example to get you started with the import process.
</Admonition>

### Reconcile your HCL with the imported state

After importing your resources using either method, you need to ensure that your HCL configuration accurately reflects the current state of the imported resources. This is an iterative process where you will:

1.  **Run `tofu plan`:**

    ```shell
    tofu plan
    ```

2.  **Understanding the plan output:**
    OpenTofu will compare your HCL `resource` blocks against the detailed state just imported from Neon.
    - The plan will likely propose to **add many attributes** to your HCL blocks. These are the actual current values of your Neon resources.
    - You might see "update in-place" actions, for example, for `neon_endpoint` it might show `+ branch_id = "your-branch-id"`. This is normal as OpenTofu reconciles the explicit configuration (where `branch_id` might be a reference that has now resolved to a concrete ID) with the imported state.

3.  **Update your HCL (`main.tf`):**
    Carefully review the `tofu plan` output. Your primary goal is to update your HCL `resource` blocks to accurately match the actual, imported state of your resources, or to define your desired state if you intend to make changes. Copy the relevant attributes and their values from the plan output into your HCL.

4.  **Repeat `tofu plan`:**
    After updating your HCL, run `tofu plan` again. Iterate until `tofu plan` shows "No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration." or only shows changes you intentionally want to make.

### Verify and reconcile

Once your HCL is fully updated, `tofu plan` should report:

```text
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

OpenTofu has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no
differences, so no changes are needed.
```

This confirms that your Neon resources are now successfully managed by OpenTofu.

## Destroying resources with OpenTofu

To remove the resources managed by OpenTofu:

```shell
tofu destroy
```

OpenTofu will ask for confirmation.
