title: Building Real-Time Comments with a Serverless Postgres
subtitle: A guide to building your own real-time comments in a Next.js application with Ably LiveSync and Postgres.
---

Can a serverless Postgres database really handle the demands of a real-time application? The answer lies in pairing it with the right publish-subscribe model. In this guide, you will learn how to combine the real-time capabilities of Ably LiveSync with the structured power of Neon Postgres to build a optimistic and scalable comment system in your Next.js application.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you’ll need the following:

- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en) or later
- A [Neon](https://console.neon.tech/signup) account
- An [Ably](https://ably.com) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account

## Create the Next.js application

Let’s get started by cloning the Next.js project with the following command:

```shell shouldWrap
git clone https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/ably-livesync-neon
```

Once that is done, move into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

```shell shouldWrap
cd ably-livesync-neon
npm install
```

The libraries installed include:

- `ws`: A WebSocket library for Node.js.
- `ably`: A real-time messaging and data synchronization library.
- `@neondatabase/serverless`: A serverless Postgres client designed for Neon.
- `@prisma/client`: Prisma’s auto-generated client for interacting with your database.
- `@prisma/adapter-neon`: A Prisma adapter for connecting with Neon serverless Postgres.
- `@ably-labs/models`: A library for working with data models and real-time updates in Ably.

The development-specific libraries include:

- `tsx`: A fast TypeScript runtime for development and rebuilding.
- `prisma`: A toolkit for Prisma schema management, migrations, and generating clients.

Once that's done, copy the `.env.example` to `.env` via the following command:

```shell shouldWrap
cp .env.example .env
```

## Provision a Serverless Postgres

To set up a serverless Postgres, go to the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) and create a new project. Once your project is created, you will receive a connection string that you can use to connect to your Neon database. The connection string will look like this:

```bash shouldWrap
postgresql://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>.neon.tech:<port>/<dbname>?sslmode=require
```

Replace `<user>`, `<password>`, `<endpoint_hostname>`, `<port>`, and `<dbname>` with your specific details.

Use this connection string as an environment variable designated as `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file.

## Set up Ably LiveSync with Neon Postgres

Sign in into the [Ably Dashboard](https://ably.com/login), and click on `+ Create new app`.

![](/guides/images/real-time-comments/create.png)

Next, name the application and select `Data Sync` as the type of application you are building.

![](/guides/images/real-time-comments/name.png)

Next, go to the **Integrations** tab and click on `+ New integration rule`.

![](/guides/images/real-time-comments/rule.png)

Next, click the `Choose` button in the **Postgres (Alpha)** card.

![](/guides/images/real-time-comments/postgres.png)

Next, in the integration rule, enter the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable value obtained and proceed.

![](/guides/images/real-time-comments/values.png)

Finally, go to the **API Keys** tab and copy the API Key which has the capabilities as `channel metadata, history, presence, privileged headers, publish, push admin, push subscribe, statistics, subscribe`.

![](/guides/images/real-time-comments/api_keys.png)

Use this API Key as an environment variable designated as `NEXT_PUBLIC_ABLY_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

## Set up Database Schema

In the file named `schema.tsx`, you would see the following code:

```tsx
// File: schema.tsx

import 'dotenv/config';
import { WebSocket } from 'ws';
import { neon, neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = WebSocket;
neonConfig.poolQueryViaFetch = true;

async function prepare() {
  if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) throw new Error('DATABASE_URL environment variable not found.');
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  await Promise.all([
    sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS nodes (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, expiry TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL);`,
    sql`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS outbox (sequence_id  serial PRIMARY KEY, mutation_id  TEXT NOT NULL, channel TEXT NOT NULL, name TEXT NOT NULL, rejected boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, data JSONB, headers JSONB, locked_by TEXT, lock_expiry TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE, processed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false);`,
  ]);
  await sql`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.outbox_notify() RETURNS trigger AS $$ BEGIN PERFORM pg_notify('ably_adbc'::text, ''::text); RETURN NULL; EXCEPTION WHEN others THEN RAISE WARNING 'unexpected error in %s: %%', SQLERRM; RETURN NULL; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`;
  await sql`CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER public_outbox_trigger AFTER INSERT ON public.outbox FOR EACH STATEMENT EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.outbox_notify();`;
  console.log('Database schema set up succesfully.');
}

prepare();
```

The code above defines a function that connects to a Neon serverless Postgres database using a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and sets up the necessary schema for the real-time application. It creates two tables, `nodes` and `outbox`, to store data and manage message processing, respectively. A trigger function, `outbox_notify`, is implemented to send notifications using `pg_notify` whenever new rows are inserted into the `outbox` table. This ensures the database is ready for real-time updates and WebSocket-based communication.

To run the schema against your Neon Postgres, execute the following command:

```
npm run db
```

If it runs succesfully, you should see `Database schema set up succesfully.` in the terminal.

## Set up Prisma for Neon Postgres

In the directory `lib/prisma`, you would see the following code in `index.ts` file:

```tsx
// File: lib/prisma/index.ts

import { neonConfig, Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { PrismaNeon } from '@prisma/adapter-neon';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { WebSocket } from 'ws';

declare global {
  var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

const connectionString = `${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`;

neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = WebSocket;
neonConfig.poolQueryViaFetch = true;

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString });
const adapter = new PrismaNeon(pool);
const prisma = global.prisma || new PrismaClient({ adapter });

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') global.prisma = prisma;

export default prisma;
```

The code above sets up a Prisma client for Neon Postgres. It configures the Neon database connection using the `@neondatabase/serverless` library, with WebSocket and `fetch` support to execute queries. A global `prisma` instance is created using the `PrismaNeon` adapter, ensuring reuse in development to avoid multiple instances. Finally, the configured `prisma` client is exported for use throughout the application.

In the same directory, you would see the following code in the `api.ts` file:

```tsx
// File: lib/prisma/api.ts

import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';
import { Prisma, PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import * as runtime from '@prisma/client/runtime/library';

export type Author = {
  id: number;
  image: string;
  username: string;
};

export type Comment = {
  id: number;
  postId: number;
  author: Author;
  content: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  optimistic?: boolean;
};

export type Post = {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  comments: Comment[];
};

export async function getPosts(): Promise<Post[]> {
  return await prisma.post.findMany({
    include: {
      comments: {
        include: {
          author: true,
        },
      },
    },
  });
}

export async function getPost(id: number): Promise<[Post, number]> {
  return await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    const post = await getPostTx(tx, id);
    type r = { nextval: number };
    const [{ nextval }] = await tx.$queryRaw<
      r[]
    >`SELECT nextval('outbox_sequence_id_seq')::integer`;
    return [post, nextval];
  });
}

async function getPostTx(tx: TxClient, id: number) {
  return await tx.post.findUniqueOrThrow({
    where: { id },
    include: {
      comments: {
        include: {
          author: true,
        },
        orderBy: {
          createdAt: 'asc',
        },
      },
    },
  });
}

export async function getRandomUser() {
  const count = await prisma.user.count();
  return await prisma.user.findFirstOrThrow({
    skip: Math.floor(Math.random() * count),
  });
}

export type TxClient = Omit<PrismaClient, runtime.ITXClientDenyList>;

export async function addComment(
  tx: TxClient,
  mutationId: string,
  postId: number,
  authorId: number,
  content: string
): Promise<Prisma.outboxCreateInput> {
  const comment = await tx.comment.create({
    data: { postId, authorId, content },
    include: { author: true },
  });
  return {
    mutation_id: mutationId,
    channel: `post:${comment.postId}`,
    name: 'addComment',
    data: comment,
    headers: {},
  };
}

export async function editComment(
  tx: TxClient,
  mutationId: string,
  id: number,
  content: string
): Promise<Prisma.outboxCreateInput> {
  await tx.comment.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id } });
  const comment = await tx.comment.update({
    where: { id },
    data: { content },
    include: { author: true },
  });
  return {
    mutation_id: mutationId,
    channel: `post:${comment.postId}`,
    name: 'editComment',
    data: comment,
    headers: {},
  };
}

export async function deleteComment(
  tx: TxClient,
  mutationId: string,
  id: number
): Promise<Prisma.outboxCreateInput> {
  const comment = await tx.comment.delete({
    where: { id },
  });
  return {
    mutation_id: mutationId,
    channel: `post:${comment.postId}`,
    name: 'deleteComment',
    data: comment,
    headers: {},
  };
}

export async function withOutboxWrite(
  op: (tx: TxClient, ...args: any[]) => Promise<Prisma.outboxCreateInput>,
  ...args: any[]
) {
  return await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    const { mutation_id, channel, name, data, headers } = await op(tx, ...args);
    await tx.outbox.create({
      data: { mutation_id, channel, name, data, headers },
    });
  });
}
```

The code above interacts with the Postgres database using Prisma to manage comments. It implements operations like fetching, adding, editing, and deleting comments, with an emphasis on ensuring these operations are recorded in the `outbox` table for the event-driven system to capturing changes and reflect them in rest of the web clients. Let's understand each function in the code above:

- `withOutboxWrite()`: **This higher-order function wraps any operation that modifies the database (such as adding, editing, or deleting a comment) and ensures that the change is also written to the outbox table.** It first performs the operation, retrieves the necessary outbox details, and then writes the entry to the outbox table within the same transaction.

- `getPosts()`: Fetches all posts from the database, along with their associated comments and the authors of those comments. The function returns a list of posts, each containing its comments and authors.

- `getPost(id: number): Promise<[Post, number]>`: Fetches a single post by its ID, along with the associated comments and authors. Additionally, it executes a raw SQL query within a transaction to get the next value from a PostgreSQL sequence (`outbox_sequence_id_seq`), returning this value alongside the post. This ensures that the operation has both the requested post and sequence number, which may be used in event-driven systems for ordering.

- `getPostTx(tx: TxClient, id: number)`: A helper function used by `getPost()` to retrieve a post within a transaction (`tx`). It ensures the post's comments are fetched in ascending order of their creation timestamp.

- `getRandomUser()`: Retrieves a random user from the database. The function first counts the total number of users and then selects one randomly based on the count.

- `TxClient`: This type represents a transaction client, which is essentially a modified version of the PrismaClient excluding certain methods that are restricted during transactions (`ITXClientDenyList`).

- `addComment()`: Adds a new comment to a post within a transaction. The function takes in several parameters, such as the transaction client (`tx`), mutation ID, post ID, author ID, and comment content. It returns an `outbox` entry that can be used in an event-driven system for tracking the mutation. The outbox entry includes details like the mutation ID, channel (based on the post), event name (`addComment`), and the newly created comment.

- `editComment()`: Edits an existing comment. It accepts the transaction client (`tx`), mutation ID, comment ID, and new content. After updating the comment, it returns an outbox entry similar to `addComment()`, but with the event name `editComment`.

- `deleteComment()`: Deletes a comment. It takes in the transaction client (`tx`), mutation ID, and the comment ID to be deleted. Like the other mutation functions, it returns an outbox entry, but with the event name `deleteComment`.

## Create a Real-Time Data Model Client with Ably

In the directory `lib/models`, you would see the following code in `modelsClient.ts` file:

```tsx
// File: lib/models/modelsClient.ts

import ModelsClient from '@ably-labs/models';
import { Realtime } from 'ably';

let client: ModelsClient;

export const modelsClient = () => {
  const ably = new Realtime({ key: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ABLY_API_KEY });
  if (!client) client = new ModelsClient({ ably });
  return client;
};
```

In the code above, a function `modelsClient` is defined which initializes and returns a singleton instance of the `ModelsClient` from the `@ably-labs/models` library, using an Ably Realtime connection. It ensures that the client is only instantiated once, leveraging the Ably API key stored in environment variables to create the Realtime connection.

In the same directory, you would see the following code in the `mutations.ts` file:

```tsx
// File: lib/models/mutations.ts

import { ConfirmedEvent, OptimisticEvent } from '@ably-labs/models';
import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep';
import type { Post as PostType } from '@/lib/prisma/api';
import type { Author as AuthorType } from '@/lib/prisma/api';
import { Comment } from '@/lib/prisma/api';

export async function addComment(
  mutationId: string,
  author: AuthorType,
  postId: number,
  content: string
) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/comments', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ mutationId, authorId: author.id, postId, content }),
  });
  if (!response.ok)
    throw new Error(
      `POST /api/comments: ${response.status} ${JSON.stringify(await response.json())}`
    );
  return response.json();
}

export async function editComment(mutationId: string, id: number, content: string) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/comments/${id}`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ mutationId, content }),
  });
  if (!response.ok)
    throw new Error(
      `PUT /api/comments/:id: ${response.status} ${JSON.stringify(await response.json())}`
    );
  return response.json();
}

export async function deleteComment(mutationId: string, id: number) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/comments/${id}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: { 'x-mutation-id': mutationId },
  });
  if (!response.ok)
    throw new Error(
      `DELETE /api/comments/:id: ${response.status} ${JSON.stringify(await response.json())}`
    );
  return response.json();
}

export function merge(existingState: PostType, event: OptimisticEvent | ConfirmedEvent): PostType {
  // Optimistic and confirmed events use the same merge function logic.
  // The models function keeps track of the state before events are applied
  // to make sure the rollback of unconfirmed events works, we need to clone
  // the state here. Our state contains an array of objects so we don't use
  // the regular object spread operator.
  const state = cloneDeep(existingState);
  switch (event.name) {
    case 'addComment':
      const newComment = event.data! as Comment;
      state.comments.push(newComment);
      break;
    case 'editComment':
      const editComment = event.data! as Comment;
      const editIdx = state.comments.findIndex((c) => c.id === editComment.id);
      state.comments[editIdx] = editComment;
      break;
    case 'deleteComment':
      const { id } = event.data! as { id: number };
      const deleteIdx = state.comments.findIndex((c) => c.id === id);
      state.comments.splice(deleteIdx, 1);
      break;
    default:
      console.error('unknown event', event);
  }
  state.comments.sort((a, b) => new Date(a.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(b.createdAt).getTime());
  return state;
}
```

In the code above, three asynchronous functions to handle CRUD operations for comments are defined:

- **addComment**: Sends a POST request to add a new comment, including the author's details and content, identified by a `mutationId`.
- **editComment**: Sends a PUT request to update an existing comment's content by its `id`.
- **deleteComment**: Sends a DELETE request to remove a comment by its `id`.

Each function validates the server response and throws an error for unsuccessful requests. Additionally, the `merge` function handles state updates by applying optimistic or confirmed events, ensuring that the state reflects comment additions, edits, or deletions accurately.

In the same directory, you would see the following code in the `hook.ts` file:

```tsx
// File: lib/models/hook.ts

'use client';

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Model, SyncReturnType } from '@ably-labs/models';
import { modelsClient } from './modelsClient';
import { merge } from '@/lib/models/mutations';
import type { Post as PostType } from '@/lib/prisma/api';

export type ModelType = Model<(id: number) => SyncReturnType<PostType>>;

export async function getPost(id: number) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/posts/${id}`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });
  if (!response.ok)
    throw new Error(
      `GET /api/posts/:id: ${response.status} ${JSON.stringify(await response.json())}`
    );
  const { sequenceId, data } = (await response.json()) as {
    sequenceId: string;
    data: PostType;
  };
  return { sequenceId, data };
}

export const useModel = (id: number | null): [PostType | undefined, ModelType | undefined] => {
  const [postData, setPostData] = useState<PostType>();
  const [model, setModel] = useState<ModelType>();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!id) return;
    const model: ModelType = modelsClient().models.get({
      channelName: `post:${id}`,
      sync: async () => getPost(id),
      merge,
    });
    setModel(model);
  }, [id]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!id || !model) return;
    const getPost = async (id: number) => await model.sync(id);
    getPost(id);
  }, [id, model]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!model) return;
    const subscribe = (err: Error | null, data?: PostType | undefined) => {
      if (err) return console.error(err);
      setPostData(data);
    };
    model.subscribe(subscribe);

    return () => model.unsubscribe(subscribe);
  }, [model]);

  return [postData, model];
};
```

In the code above, the following function and hook are defined:

1. **getPost**: Fetches the initial post data and its sequence ID from an API endpoint.
2. **useModel**: Manages a model instance and its associated state. The hook returns the synchronized post data and model instance for use in components. It:
   - Initializes the model with a channel name, `sync` function (to fetch data), and merge logic.
   - Synchronizes the model with the latest data when the `id` changes.
   - Subscribes to real-time updates from the model, updating the component state accordingly.

## API Routes for Comments and Real-Time Synchronization

To perform server-side operations as a result of user interaction on the webpage, a common pattern is to use API routes. In Next.js, API Routes (aka Endpoint Handlers) can be created by creating a file named `route.ts` in any directory in the `app` directory.

To allow dynamic updates and the ability to delete comments, you would see the following code in `route.ts` file in the `app/api/comments/[id]` directory:

```tsx
// File: app/api/comments/[id]/route.ts

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store';

import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { withOutboxWrite, editComment, deleteComment } from '@/lib/prisma/api';

export async function PUT(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  try {
    const id = Number((await params).id);
    const comment: { mutationId: string; content: string } = await request.json();
    const data = await withOutboxWrite(editComment, comment.mutationId, id, comment.content);
    return NextResponse.json({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('failed to update comment', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ message: 'failed to update comment', error }, { status: 500 });
  }
}

export async function DELETE(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  try {
    const id = Number((await params).id);
    const mutationId = request.headers.get('x-mutation-id') || 'missing';
    const data = await withOutboxWrite(deleteComment, mutationId, id);
    return NextResponse.json({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('failed to delete comment', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ message: 'failed to delete comment', error }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

In the code above, there are two endpoints, `PUT` and `DELETE`, both of which parse the `id` param in the request. The `PUT` endpoint extracts the comment properties (`mutationId`, `content`) to edit the comment in Postgres and sync the changes to the rest of the web clients that are actively looking to stream comment changes in real-time.

To allow the ability to insert comments, you would see the following code in `route.ts` file in the `app/api/comments` directory:

```tsx
// File: app/api/comments/route.ts

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store';

import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { withOutboxWrite, addComment } from '@/lib/prisma/api';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const comment: {
      mutationId: string;
      postId: number;
      authorId: number;
      content: string;
    } = await request.json();
    const data = await withOutboxWrite(
      addComment,
      comment.mutationId,
      comment.postId,
      comment.authorId,
      comment.content
    );
    return NextResponse.json({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('failed to add comment', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ message: 'failed to add comment', error }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

In the code above, the endpoint parses the request's body to extract the comment properties (`mutationID`, `postId`, `authorId`, `content`). Further, it inserts into Postgres using the `withOutboxWrite` helper function which makes sure to sync it in Postgres and rest of the web clients that are actively looking to stream comments in real-time.

Similarly, you would see the following code in `route.ts` file in the `app/api/posts/[id]` directory:

```tsx
// File: app/api/posts/[id]/route.ts

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store';

import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { getPost } from '@/lib/prisma/api';

export async function GET(_: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  try {
    const id = Number((await params).id);
    const [data, sequenceId] = await getPost(id);
    return NextResponse.json({ sequenceId, data });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ message: 'failed to get post', error }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

In the code above, the endpoint parses the `id` param in the request and returns the `sequenceId` and the comment details associated with that ID in Postgres.

## Deploy to Vercel

The repository is now ready to deploy to Vercel. Use the following steps to deploy:

- Start by creating a GitHub repository containing your app's code.
- Then, navigate to the Vercel Dashboard and create a **New Project**.
- Link the new project to the GitHub repository you've just created.
- In **Settings**, update the **Environment Variables** to match those in your local `.env` file.
- Deploy.
