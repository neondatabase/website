# Guides

Welcome to Neon guides! This folder contains the source code of the [Neon guides](https://neon.tech/guides/).

## Basic information

1. Every single Markdown file in this folder will be turned into a guides page.
2. Folder and file names should follow kebab-case.
3. `slug` is generated based on the folder structure and file names inside this folder. In order to see page `slug`, you can [start](../../README.md#run-the-website) and build the project with `npm run build` command that will display all generated pages.
4. Page `path` is generated by combining [`GUIDES_BASE_PATH`](../../src/constants/guides.js) and page `slug`.
5. There is no need to add `h1` to the page since it will be displayed automatically with the value from `title` field.

## Fields

Right now Markdown files accept the following fields:

1. `title` — title of the page (required)
2. `subtitle` — subtitle of the page.
3. `author` — your author ID.
4. `redirectFrom` — array of strings with paths to redirect from to the page, should start and end with a slash, e.g. `/guides/old-path/`
5. `isDraft` — flag that says the page is not ready yet. It won't appear in production but will appear in the development mode.
6. `enableTableOfContents` — flag that turns on the display of the outline for the page. The outline gets built out of second and third-level headings ([`h2`, `h3`]), thus appears as two-level nested max.
7. `ogImage` - the social preview image of the page.

> ⚠️ Please note that the project won't build if at least one of the Markdown files is missing a required field.

## Code blocks

All available languages for code blocks can be found [here](https://shiki.matsu.io/languages).

You can use fenced code blocks with three backticks (```) on the lines before and after the code block. And display code with options

- enable highlighting single lines, multiple lines, and ranges of code lines

  Examples:

  - Single line highlight

    ````md
    ```c++ {1}
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        std::cout << "Hello World";
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ````

  - Multiple lines

    ````md
    ```c++ {1,2,5}
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        std::cout << "Hello World";
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ````

  - Range of code lines

    ````md
    ```c++ {1-3,5}
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        std::cout << "Hello World";
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ````

- use `[!code highlight]` to highlight a line.

  ```ts
  export function foo() {
    console.log('Highlighted'); // [!code highlight]
  }
  ```

- use `[!code word:xxx]` to highlight a word.

  ```ts
  export function foo() {
    // [!code word:Hello]
    const msg = 'Hello World';
    console.log(msg); // prints Hello World
  }
  ```

- `showLineNumbers` - flag to show on the line numbers in the code block.

  Example:

  ````md
  ```c++ showLineNumbers
  #include <iostream>

  int main() {
      std::cout << "Hello World";
      return 0;
  }
  ```
  ````

- `shouldWrap` - flag to enable code wrapping in the code block.

  Example:

  ````md
  ```powershell shouldWrap
  powershell -Command "Start-Process -FilePath powershell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList '-NoProfile','-InputFormat None','-ExecutionPolicy Bypass','-Command ""iex (iwr -UseBasicParsing https://cli.configu.com/install.ps1)""'"
  ```
  ````

## Code Tabs

To display code tabs, wrap all pieces of code with `<CodeTabs></CodeTabs>` and write labels of code tabs in order:

````md
<CodeTabs labels={["Shell", "C++", "C#", "Java"]}>

```bash {2-4}
#!/bin/bash
STR="Hello World!"
echo $STR
```

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```

```csharp
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Hello {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
        }
    }
}
```

```java
import java.io.*;

class GFG {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
       System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

</CodeTabs>
````

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

![Code tabs example](../docs/code-tabs-example.jpg)

</details>

## Tabs

To display the tabs with content as image, video, code block, .etc, wrap the `TabItem` with `Tabs`

````md
<Tabs labels={["Content", "CLI"]}>

<TabItem>
In your config v3 project, head to the `/metadata/databases/databases.yaml` file and add the database configuration as below.

```bash showLineNumbers
- name: <db_name>
  kind: postgres
  configuration:
    connection_info:
      database_url:
        from_env: <DB_URL_ENV_VAR>
    pool_settings:
      idle_timeout: 180
      max_connections: 50
      retries: 1
  tables: []
  functions: []
```

Apply the Metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

If you've spun up the Hasura Engine with Docker, you can access the Hasura Console by accessing it in a browser at the URL of your Hasura Engine instance, usually http://localhost:8080.

<Admonition type="note">
To access the Hasura Console via the URL the HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE environment variable or the `--enable-console` flag must be set to true.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
Alternatively, you can create read replicas using the Neon API or Neon CLI.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/late-bar-27572981/endpoints \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "type": "read_only",
    "branch_id": "br-young-fire-15282225"
  }
}
' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
````

## Admonition

To improve the guides readability, one can leverage an Admonition custom component. Just wrap your piece of text with `<Admonition></Admonition>` and pass the type.

There are 6 types of Admonition: `note`, `important`, `tip`, `warning`, `info`, `comingSoon`; the default is `note`.

You may also specify an optional title with prop `title`.

Example:

```md
<Admonition type="note" title="Your title">
  The branch creation process does not increase load on the originating project. You can create a branch at any time without worrying about downtime or performance degradation.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  The branch creation process does not increase load on the originating project. You can create a branch at any time without worrying about downtime or performance degradation.
</Admonition>
```

</details>

## CTA

This is a simple block with title, description text and one CTA button that accomplish certain actions.

```md
<CTA />
```

Check the example for default data of CTA block

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

![CTA example](../docs/cta-example.jpg)

</details>

To change text in CTA block, you can pass to the component props `title`, `description`, `buttonText`, `buttonUrl`:

```md
<CTA title="Try it on Neon!" description="Neon is Serverless Postgres built for the cloud. Explore Postgres features and functions in our user-friendly SQL editor. Sign up for a free account to get started." buttonText="Sign Up" buttonUrl="https://console.neon.tech/signup" />
```

## Images

The images should be sourced in `public/guides` directory and be used in `.md` with the relative path, that begins with a `/` slash

Example file structure:

```md
├── public
│ ├── guides
│ │ ├── conceptual-guides
│ │ ├── neon_architecture_2.png // put images in a directory with the same name as the .md file
├── content
│ ├── guides
│ │ ├── conceptual-guides
│ │ ├── architecture-overview.md
```

To display images using Markdown syntax, use the following syntax: `![alt text](image url)`. Example content in `architecture-overview.md`:

```md
![Neon architecture diagram](/guides/conceptual-guides/neon_architecture_2.png)
```

If you need an image without border to show an annotated piece of UI, use the `"no-border"` attribute as in the example below:

```md
![Neon architecture diagram](/guides/conceptual-guides/neon_architecture_2.png 'no-border')
```

With this approach, all images on your guide pages will be displayed both on the production and GitHub preview.

## Definition list

Custom `mdx` component that makes possible using [extended markdown syntax for descriptions lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#definition-lists). Fully [WCAG-compliant](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H40.html). It provides an accessible way to make term lists, and it's a generally good way to add structure to a text when a writer needs more than bullets and less than headings.

The usage is pretty [straightforward](https://github.com/neondatabase/website/pull/231/commits/8f795eaf700c31794a2267fc5978c22bfc649a0c):

```md
[comment]: <> (other content here)

<DefinitionList>
[comment]: <> (required new line)
Scenario executor
: First definition
: Second definition

Soak test
: First and only definition

Smoke test
Another term for smoke test
: First definition for both terms
: Second definition for both terms
: ...n definition for both terms

[Stress test](/)
: First and **only** definition for both terms with additional markup <br/> Read more: [link](/)

[comment]: <> (other content here)
</DefinitionList>

[comment]: <> (other content here)
```

### Acceptable markup for term

- `*italic*`
- `[link](/)`
- `**strong**` - but that doesn't make sense, by default terms appearance is already bold
- `inlineCode` - but it doesn't alter it's change in this context

### Constraints

- using emojis in `dt` is prohibited, as it potentially can mess up with `id` attribute, and `href` at anchor. We can not be sure which range will be used to display a particular symbol (depends on editor OS) and if it is going to be stripped.
- if there are multiple terms for a given set of descriptions, only the first one will have an `id` and an `anchor`
- make absolutely sure your `dt` text content is unique across the page to avoid `id` collisions

### Acceptable markup for description

- everything for term
- emojis
- any inline html
- line breaks `<br/>` (recommended way to separate visually something inside a single description)

## Detail Icon Cards

`DetailIconCards` is a custom MDX component that displays data in a card format. Each card contains icon, title, href and description. This layout is especially useful for presenting grouped information in a visually pleasing and easy-to-understand way.

```md
<DetailIconCards>

<a href="https://api-guides.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api" description="Collaborate on open-source projects" icon="github">Headless vector search</a>

<a href="https://api-guides.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api" description="Collaborate on open-source projects" icon="github">Open AI completions</a>

</DetailIconCards>
```

## Shared MDX components

Create a [markdown file](https://github.com/neondatabase/website/blob/main/content/docs/shared-content/need-help.md) in folder `content/docs/shared-content/`, add to `sharedMdxComponents` the name of component and the path to component.

```js
const sharedMdxComponents = {
  // ConponentName: 'shared-content/component-filename'
  NeedHelp: 'shared-content/need-help',
};

export default sharedMdxComponents;
```

Insert a shared markdown and render inline.

```md
## Resources

- [Open AI tiktoken source code on GitHub](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)
- [pg_tiktoken source code on GitHub](https://github.com/kelvich/pg_tiktoken)

<NeedHelp/>
```

You can pass props to the shared component:

```md
<ComponentWithProps text="The pgvector extension" />
```

component-with-props.md

```md
<Admonition type="note" title="Test component with props">
  {text}
</Admonition>
```

## Author data

Your author's data should be sourced in `content/guides/authors/data.json` file.

You should start with your name as the ID for the object in kebab-case. Then you can use these fields inside the object:

1. `name` — your name (required).
2. `position` — your position.
3. `bio` — your bio.
4. `link` — link to one of your social media accounts. Each link should have `title` and `url` fields.

Then you can add your photo to `public/guides/authors/` folder with the filename as your ID.

Please make sure that your ID is the same in your author's data, in `content/guides/authors/data.json`, and the photo filename.

Example usage:

```md
├── content
│ ├── guides
│ ├── next-server-actions.md // your guide
│ ├── authors
│ ├── data.json // your data here
├── public
│ ├── guides
│ ├── authors
│ ├── rishi-raj-jain.jpg // your photo
```

`content/guides/next-server-actions.md`:

```md
---
title: ...
author: rishi-raj-jain
---
```

`content/guides/authors/data.json`:

```json
{
  "rishi-raj-jain": {
    "name": "Rishi Raj Jain",
    "position": "Software Engineer",
    "bio": "Technical Writer",
    "link": {
      "title": "GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/rishi-raj-jain"
    }
  }
}
```

With this approach, all your data will be displayed in guide's author section.

## Contributing

For small changes and spelling fixes, we recommend using the GitHub UI because Markdown files are relatively easy to edit.

For larger contributions, consider [running the project locally](../../README.md#getting-started) to see how changes look like before making a pull request.
