Vector search enables you to perform similarity searches on vectors stored in Postgres.
With the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension, you can store and efficiently query vector embeddings, making Postgres a viable option for AI-driven applications like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and semantic search.

## Steps

- Install and enable pgvector
- Create a table with a vector column
- Insert and retrieve vector data
- Perform nearest neighbor searches
- Index using HNSW indexes
- Insert and retrieve embeddings

## Install and enable pgvector

Before using vector search, you need to install the [`pgvector` extension](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).
The `pgvector` extension adds a `vector` data type, operators for similarity search (`<->`, `<#>`, `<=>`) , and support for ANN indexes.
In Neon, `pgvector` is already installed, you just need to enable it using the following command.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

## Create a table with a vector column

To store vector embeddings, create a table with a vector column.
You must specify the size (also known as _dimensionality_) of the vectors when defining the column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE embeddings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  data VECTOR(3) -- 3-dimensional vector example
);
```

## Insert and retrieve vector data

You can insert vectors as arrays using the following command.
Under the hood, vectors are just fixed-length arrays of floats.

```sql
INSERT INTO embeddings (data)
VALUES ('[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]'),
       ('[0.5, 0.1, 0.8]');
```

You can retrieve all stored vectors using the following command.

```sql
SELECT * FROM embeddings;
```

## Perform nearest neighbor searches

Vector search typically means finding the closest vectors in the database to a given vector.
There are different distance metrics to calculate which vector is closest, like Euclidean distance (`<->`), cosine similarity (`<#>`), and inner product (`<=>`).

For example, the following command runs nearest neighbor search to find the most similar vector to `[0.2, 0.1, 0.3]` using Euclidean distance, which is `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM embeddings
ORDER BY data <-> '[0.2, 0.1, 0.3]'
LIMIT 1;
```

## Index using HNSW indexes

For large datasets, exact nearest neighbor search can be slow.
`pgvector` supports two different indexes for nearest neighbor search: HNSW and IVFFlat.

The following command creates a HNSW index.

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON embeddings USING hnsw (data);
```

## Insert and retrieve embeddings

Vector databases are typically used to store _embeddings_.
An embedding is a numerical representation of data in a high-dimensional space that captures semantic relationships and similarities between entities.
First, run the following command to recreate the `embeddings` table to store vectors with dimensionality 512.

```sql
DROP TABLE embeddings;

CREATE TABLE embeddings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  data VECTOR(512)
);
```

For example, the following command inserts a pair of 512 dimensionality vectors containing text embeddings pulled from the [Nomic API](https://docs.nomic.ai/reference/api/embed-text-v-1-embedding-text-post).
The first embedding represents the string "i like to eat tacos", the second represents the string "An embedding is a numerical representation of data in a high-dimensional space that captures semantic relationships and similarities between entities."

```sql
INSERT INTO embeddings (data)
VALUES
  /* Embedding representation of "i like to eat tacos" */

You can then query for which embeddings are closest to a new vector.
For example, the following query finds the closest vector to the embedding for "burgers are tasty" using cosine similarity `<#>`.
Unsurprisingly, Postgres returns the "i like to eat tacos" vector.

```sql
SELECT * FROM embeddings
ORDER BY data <#>
