Imagine you could interact with your database using plain English, whether you're asking for specific data or changing its schema. That's what the [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon) allows you to do. It lets you manage your Neon Postgres databases using everyday language, simplifying tasks like running queries and performing database migrations.

In this guide, we'll explore how to set up the Neon MCP Server within [Zed](https://zed.dev), a next-generation AI-powered code editor, to handle various database operations. These include creating projects, managing database branches, running SQL queries, and performing safe database migrations.

<Admonition type="note">
MCP support in Zed is currently in **preview**. Ensure you're using the Preview version of Zed to add MCP servers. You can download the **Preview** version from [zed.dev/releases/preview](https://zed.dev/releases/preview).
</Admonition>

## Setting up Neon MCP Server in Zed

You have two options for connecting Zed to the Neon MCP Server:

1.  **Remote MCP Server (Preview):** Connect to Neon's managed MCP server using OAuth for authentication. This method is more convenient as it eliminates the need to manage API keys in Zed. Additionally, you will automatically receive the latest features and improvements as soon as they are released.

2.  **Local MCP Server:** Run the Neon MCP server locally on your machine, authenticating with a Neon API key.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Zed editor:** Download and install preview version of Zed from [zed.dev/releases/preview](https://zed.dev/releases/preview).
2.  **A Neon account and project:** You'll need a Neon account and a project. You can quickly create a new Neon project here [pg.new](https://pg.new)
3.  **Neon API Key (for Local MCP server):** After signing up, get your Neon API Key from the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys). This API key is needed to authenticate your application with Neon. For instructions, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

    <Admonition type="warning" title="Neon API Key Security">
    Keep your Neon API key secure, and never share it publicly. It provides access to your Neon projects.
    </Admonition>

4.  **Node.js (>= v18) and npm:** Ensure Node.js (version 18 or later) and npm are installed. Download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

<Admonition type="note">
In Zed, MCP servers are known as **context servers**. These context servers enable context-aware capabilities, facilitating Zed's interaction with external systems such as Neon.

      ```bash
      npx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start <YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>
      ```
      ![Zed add Neon Local MCP server](/docs/guides/zed/add-neon-local-mcp-server.png)
    - Click **Add Server**.

6.  Check the Context Servers section in Zed Settings to ensure the connection is successful. Neon should be listed as a context server.
    ![Zed with Neon MCP Tools](/docs/guides/zed/with-neon-mcp-tools.png)

7.  Zed is now connected to Neon's local MCP server.

### Verification

With the Neon MCP server set up either remotely or locally, you can now verify the connection and test the available tools.

1.  Open Zed Assistant.

2.  Type `List my Neon projects` in the Assistant text field.
    ![Zed list neon projects](/docs/guides/zed/list_neon_projects.png)

3.  When prompted, click **Allow** to authorize the tool to access your Neon project.
    ![Zed allow tool access](/docs/guides/zed/allow_tool_access.png)

4.  Zed will use the `list_projects` MCP tool to retrieve and display your Neon projects, including project ID, name, and other details.
    ![Zed list projects](/docs/guides/zed/list_projects.png)

5.  Try other commands such as listing all tables, creating a new branch, creating a new project, or running SQL queries.

### Troubleshooting

If you experience issues adding an MCP server from the Assistant panel, you can also do so through the **Settings**. Follow these steps:

1.  Open the `~/.config/zed/settings.json` file. You can access this file by clicking on **Settings** in the Zed menu bar.
2.  Add the following `context_servers` section to the file.

<CodeTabs labels={["Remote MCP server", "Local MCP server"]}>

```json
"context_servers": {
   "neon": {
      "command": {
         "path": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.neon.tech/sse"],
         "env": null
      },
      "settings": {}
   }
}
```

```json
"context_servers": {
   "neon": {
      "command": {
         "path": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon", "start", "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"],
         "env": null
      },
      "settings": {}
   }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

#### Troubleshooting on Windows

If you are using Windows, and you encounter issues with the command line, you may need to adjust the command to use `cmd` or `wsl` to run the MCP server. For example, here's how you can set it up:

<CodeTabs labels={["Windows", "Windows (WSL)"]}>

```json
"context_servers": {
   "neon": {
      "command": {
         "path": "cmd",
         "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon", "start", "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"],
         "env": null
      },
      "settings": {}
   }
}
```

```json
"context_servers": {
   "neon": {
      "command": {
         "path": "wsl",
         "args": ["npx", "-y", "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon", "start", "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"],
         "env": null
      },
      "settings": {}
   }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

<MCPTools />

These actions enable any MCP client like Zed to interact with various functionalities of the **Neon platform via the Neon API.** Certain tools, especially database migration ones, are tailored for AI agent and LLM usage, leveraging Neon's branching for safe preview and commit.

## Development Workflow: Adding a Column with Zed and Neon MCP

Let's walk through a typical development scenario: Quickly adding a column for prototyping using natural language within Zed. The following chat log demonstrates a real interaction with Zed and the Neon MCP server.

**Scenario:** During development, you decide to track timestamps for entries in your `playing_with_neon` table. You want to quickly add a `created_at` column.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Security Reminder">
For your security, review the tool's purpose before permitting the operation to proceed. Remember that LLMs can sometimes produce unexpected results, so careful monitoring is always recommended.
</Admonition>

Here's the conversation log between the user and Zed:

![Zed listing projects](/docs/guides/zed/mcp-neon-adding-column-1.png)

```text shouldWrap
User: List my neon projects
Zed: I'll use the list_projects tool to show your Neon projects.
> Run MCP tool `list_projects`
> You have one Neon project:
> Name: mcp
> Project ID: red-math-82356803
> Region: aws-ap-southeast-1
> ...other details...

User: what tables are present in it?
Zed: I'll use the `get_database_tables` tool to list the tables in your project. I'll use the project ID we just found.
> Run MCP tool `get_database_tables`
> There is one table in your project's database:
> Schema: public
> Table Name: `playing_with_neon`
> Type: Base Table
> Let me fetch the details of this table's schema so you can see its structure:
> Run MCP tool `describe_table_schema`
> The "playing_with_neon" table has three columns:
> 1. id: An auto-incrementing integer (primary key)
> 2. value: A real (floating-point) number that can be null
> 3. name: A text field that cannot be null

Would you like to see the data in this table or perform any operations on it?
```

![Zed showing table schema](/docs/guides/zed/mcp-neon-adding-column-2.png)

```text
User: Can you show me first 5 rows in it?
Zed: I'll query the first 5 rows from the playing_with_neon table:
> Run MCP tool `run_sql`
> xxx (table rows are returned by Zed)

User: can you add a created_at column to the table?
Zed: I'll use the prepare_database_migration tool to add a created_at column to the playing_with_neon table:
> Run MCP tool `prepare_database_migration`
> I've added the `created_at` column in a temporary branch. Let me verify the change by checking the table structure:
> Run MCP tool `run_sql`
> I've verified that the created_at column has been successfully added in the temporary branch.
> Migration Details:
> - Migration ID: a78e2a3b-8498-48a0-9c7a-2dec30da84bc
> - Temporary Branch Name: br-royal-mode-a1nfvzag
> - Temporary Branch ID: br-royal-mode-a1nfvzag
> - Migration Result: Success
> Would you like to commit this migration to the production branch?

User: yes do it
Zed: I'll complete the migration using the provided migration ID:
> Run MCP tool `complete_database_migration`
> The migration has been successfully completed. The `created_at` column has been added to the `playing_with_neon` table in the production branch, and the temporary branch has been deleted.
```

![Zed completing migration](/docs/guides/zed/mcp-neon-adding-column-3.png)

**Key takeaways:**

- **Natural language interaction:** You can use simple, conversational English to interact with your database.
- **Step-by-step guidance:** Zed (Claude) confirms each step and provides details like branch names and migration IDs.
- **MCP Tools in action:** The underlying MCP tools (`get_database_tables`, `run_sql`, `prepare_database_migration`, `complete_database_migration`) illustrate the automated process.
- **Branching for safety:** The agent automatically creates a temporary branch for schema changes. The user will be prompted to confirm the migration before applying it to the production branch.

You can verify the changes in your Neon Console or by querying the database directly.

![Neon Console with added column](/docs/guides/neon-cursor-mcp-added-column.png)

<Admonition type="note">
While the Neon MCP server allows you to utilize all of Neon's functionalities, you can also use a [generic Postgres MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres) to connect to Neon.
</Admonition>

## Bonus: Creating a project and branch

Beyond schema changes, you can also manage your Neon projects and branches directly within Zed using natural language commands. This can be useful for quickly setting up a new development or test environment.

### Creating a new project

Let's say you want to create a new Neon project named "my-new-project". You can simply tell Zed:

```text shouldWrap
User: Create a Neon project named "my-new-project"
Zed: I'll create a new Neon project with the specified name.
> Run MCP tool `create_project`
> I've successfully created a new Neon project named "my-new-project". Here are the key details:
> - Project ID: red-frog-93550744
> - Default Branch: main (ID: br-shiny-water-a5us05x3)
> - Default Database: neondb
> The project is ready to use. You can now create tables, add data, or perform other database operations. Would you like to perform any specific operations with your new project?
```

![Zed creating a new Neon project](/docs/guides/zed/mcp-create-new-project.png)

Zed will then use the `create_project` MCP tool to initiate the project creation. It will provide you with a project ID, default branch, and database details. You can then proceed to create tables or perform other operations within this project.

### Creating a New Branch

Once you have a project, you can easily create new branches for development or experimentation. For example, to create a branch named "feature-x" in your "my-new-project" project:

```text shouldWrap
User: Create a branch named "feature-x"
Zed: I'll create a new branch named "feature-x" in your project.
> Run MCP tool `create_branch`
> I've successfully created a new branch named "feature-x" in your project. Here are the details:
> - Branch Name: feature-x
> - Branch ID: br-gentle-dream-a5u9fmm4
> - Parent Branch: br-shiny-water-a5us05x3
> The branch is ready for use. Would you like to perform any specific operations in this branch?
```

![Zed creating a new Neon branch](/docs/guides/zed/mcp-create-new-branch.png)

Zed will use the `create_branch` MCP tool to create the branch and provide you with the branch name and ID. Notice how we don't need to specify the project ID, as Zed remembers the active project context.

## Conclusion

Zed combined with the Neon MCP Server, whether using the **Remote Hosted (Preview)** option or the **Local Server** setup, lets you use natural language to interact with your database and take advantage of Neon's branching capabilities for fast iteration. This approach is ideal for quickly testing
database ideas and making schema changes during development.
