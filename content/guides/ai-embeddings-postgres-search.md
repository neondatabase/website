Traditional text search relies on exact keyword matches, which often misses the semantic meaning behind queries.

When someone searches for "car maintenance," they might also be interested in results about "vehicle servicing" or "auto repair", but keyword-based search won't make these connections.

AI embeddings solve this problem by converting text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning. Words and phrases with similar meanings cluster together in this vector space, enabling search systems that understand context and intent rather than just matching exact words.

The pgvector extension brings vector similarity search directly into PostgreSQL, letting you store embeddings alongside your regular data and perform complex semantic searches with simple SQL queries. Combined with Neon's serverless PostgreSQL, you can build intelligent search systems that scale automatically with your application's needs.

In this guide, you'll learn how to build a semantic search system that can power document search and content recommendations using OpenAI embeddings stored in Neon with pgvector.

## What you'll build

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

- An understanding of AI embeddings and how they improve search
- A Neon database configured with the pgvector extension
- An embedding generation service powered by OpenAI's API
- A document search system that understands semantic similarity

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you'll need:

- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/signup) with a project
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Node.js 20.x or later installed
- Basic familiarity with SQL and REST APIs
- Understanding of JavaScript promises and async/await

## Understanding AI embeddings and vector search

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand how AI embeddings work and why they're great for search.

### What are embeddings?

Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning in high-dimensional space. When you send text to OpenAI's embedding API, it returns an array of floating-point numbers (typically 1,536 dimensions for the `text-embedding-3-small` model) that represents the "meaning" of that text.

Here's a simplified example of how embeddings work:

```javascript
// These texts have similar meanings
const text1 = "The cat jumped over the fence";
const text2 = "A feline leaped across a barrier";

// Their embeddings would be mathematically similar
const embedding1 = [-0.02, 0.15, -0.08, ...]; // 1,536 numbers
const embedding2 = [-0.01, 0.16, -0.09, ...]; // Similar values
```

The key insight is that semantically similar texts produce similar embedding vectors. This enables search systems that can find relevant content even when it doesn't share exact keywords with the query.

### Why pgvector?

pgvector extends PostgreSQL with vector data types and similarity search operations. Instead of moving your data to specialized vector databases, you can store embeddings alongside your existing relational data and perform vector similarity searches with SQL:

```sql
-- Find documents most similar to a query embedding
SELECT title, content,
       embedding <-> $1 as distance
FROM documents
ORDER BY embedding <-> $1
LIMIT 5;
```

The `<->` operator calculates the distance between vectors, with smaller distances indicating higher similarity.

Now let's build a system that puts these concepts to work.

## Setting up pgvector on Neon

We'll start by enabling pgvector on your Neon database and creating the necessary tables for our search system.

First, create a new Neon project optimized for vector operations:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Name your project "semantic-search-system"
4. Choose a region close to your users
5. Select at least 1 CU for compute size (vector operations can be CPU-intensive)

Once your project is created, we need to enable the pgvector extension. Connect to your database and run this SQL:

```sql
-- Enable the pgvector extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

-- Verify the extension is working
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';
```

This command adds vector data types and similarity functions to your PostgreSQL database. You should see confirmation that the vector extension is now available.

Next, we'll create the database schema for our semantic search system. This includes tables for documents and their embeddings, along with indexes for fast vector similarity search.

```sql
-- Table for storing documents with their embeddings
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    embedding vector(1536) -- OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small produces 1536-dimensional vectors
);

-- Create indexes for fast vector similarity search
CREATE INDEX documents_embedding_idx ON documents USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

The `vector(1536)` data type stores 1,536-dimensional vectors, matching OpenAI's embedding size. The `ivfflat` indexes enable fast approximate nearest neighbor searches using cosine similarity, this is crucial for performance when searching through thousands of embeddings.

## Building an embedding generation service

Now we'll create a Node.js service that handles the complexities of generating embeddings with [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings). This service will be the bridge between your text content and the vector representations stored in the database.

Let's set up the project structure and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
mkdir semantic-search-service
cd semantic-search-service
npm init -y
npm install openai pg dotenv express cors
```

Create a `.env` file to securely store your API credentials:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@ep-abc123.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb
```

Now let's create an embedding service that handles OpenAI API interactions. This service will preprocess text, generate embeddings, and handle errors gracefully:

```javascript
// embedding.js
const OpenAI = require('openai');
require('dotenv').config();

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

class EmbeddingService {
  constructor() {
    this.model = 'text-embedding-3-small'; // Cost-effective and performant
    this.maxTokens = 8191; // Maximum tokens for this model
  }

  async generateEmbedding(text) {
    try {
      // Clean and prepare text for embedding generation
      const cleanText = this.preprocessText(text);

      const response = await openai.embeddings.create({
        model: this.model,
        input: cleanText,
      });

      return response.data[0].embedding;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error generating embedding:', error);
      throw new Error(`Failed to generate embedding: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }

  preprocessText(text) {
    // Remove extra whitespace and normalize the text
    let cleaned = text.trim().replace(/\s+/g, ' ');

    // Truncate if too long (rough estimate: 1 token ≈ 4 characters)
    const maxChars = this.maxTokens * 3; // Conservative estimate
    if (cleaned.length > maxChars) {
      cleaned = cleaned.substring(0, maxChars) + '...';
    }

    return cleaned;
  }

  // Create optimized text for embedding generation
  createDocumentText(title, content, category = '') {
    return `Title: ${title}\nCategory: ${category}\nContent: ${content}`;
  }
}

module.exports = EmbeddingService;
```

This service handles a few important tasks: it preprocesses text to ensure it fits within OpenAI's token limits, combines document fields into optimized text for better embeddings, and provides error handling for API calls. The `createDocumentText` method is particularly important because it structures the input text in a way that produces better semantic embeddings.

As of the time of writing, OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model is the newest and most cost-effective for generating embeddings.

## Creating a document management system

Now we'll build a service that manages documents in our database and automatically generates embeddings for each document. This service will handle both individual documents and batch operations.

Let's create the document service that ties together our database and embedding generation:

```javascript
// document-service.js
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const EmbeddingService = require('./embedding');
require('dotenv').config();

class DocumentService {
  constructor() {
    this.pool = new Pool({
      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
      ssl: true,
      max: 20,
    });
    this.embeddingService = new EmbeddingService();
  }

  async addDocument(title, content, category = null) {
    const client = await this.pool.connect();

    try {
      await client.query('BEGIN');

      // Combine document fields into optimized text for embedding
      const fullText = this.embeddingService.createDocumentText(title, content, category || '');

      // Generate embedding using OpenAI API
      console.log(`Generating embedding for document: ${title}`);
      const embedding = await this.embeddingService.generateEmbedding(fullText);
      const formattedEmbedding = `[${embedding.join(',')}]`;

      // Store document with its embedding in the database
      const result = await client.query(
        `
        INSERT INTO documents (title, content, category, embedding)
        VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
        RETURNING id, title, created_at
      `,
        [title, content, category, formattedEmbedding]
      );

      await client.query('COMMIT'); // Complete transaction

      console.log(`Document added successfully: ${result.rows[0].id}`);
      return result.rows[0];
    } catch (error) {
      await client.query('ROLLBACK'); // Undo changes on error
      console.error('Error adding document:', error);
      throw error;
    } finally {
      client.release(); // Return connection to pool
    }
  }

  async searchDocuments(query, limit = 10, category = null) {
    try {
      // First, convert the search query into an embedding
      const fullText = this.embeddingService.createDocumentText(query, '', category || '');
      const queryEmbedding = await this.embeddingService.generateEmbedding(fullText);

      // Format embedding as a pgvector-compatible string
      const formattedEmbedding = `[${queryEmbedding.join(',')}]`;

      // Start building the SQL query
      let sql = `
            SELECT 
                id,
                title,
                content,
                category,
                created_at,
                1 - (embedding <=> $1) as similarity_score
            FROM documents
            WHERE 1 - (embedding <=> $1) > 0.3
            `;

      const params = [formattedEmbedding];

      // Add category filter if needed
      if (category) {
        sql += ` WHERE category = $2`;
        params.push(category);
      }

      // Append ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses
      sql += ` ORDER BY embedding <=> $1 LIMIT $${params.length + 1}`;
      params.push(limit);

      const result = await this.pool.query(sql, params);

      // Format results
      return result.rows.map((row) => ({
        ...row,
        similarity_score: parseFloat(row.similarity_score.toFixed(4)),
        preview: row.content.length > 200 ? row.content.substring(0, 200) + '...' : row.content,
      }));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error searching documents:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async getDocumentById(id) {
    try {
      const result = await this.pool.query(
        `
        SELECT id, title, content, category, created_at
        FROM documents 
        WHERE id = $1
      `,
        [id]
      );

      return result.rows[0] || null;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error getting document:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

module.exports = DocumentService;
```

This service provides the core functionality for our semantic search system. The `addDocument` method generates embeddings and stores them alongside the document data, while `searchDocuments` performs the actual semantic search by converting queries to embeddings and finding the most similar documents using pgvector's distance operators.

The key insight here is the `<=>` operator in the SQL query, this calculates cosine distance between vectors, with smaller values indicating higher similarity. We convert this to a similarity score between 0 and 1 for easier interpretation.

The `getDocumentById` method retrieves a specific document by its ID, allowing applications to fetch full content when needed.

## Building the search API

With our document service in place, let's create an Express API that exposes our document search capabilities to applications.

This API will provide endpoints for adding documents and performing semantic searches.

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const DocumentService = require('./document-service');
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());

const documentService = new DocumentService();

// Add a single document with automatic embedding generation
app.post('/documents', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { title, content, category } = req.body;

    // Validate required fields
    if (!title || !content) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: 'Title and content are required',
      });
    }

    // Add document and generate embedding
    const result = await documentService.addDocument(title, content, category);
    res.status(201).json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding document:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: 'Failed to add document',
      message: error.message,
    });
  }
});

// Perform semantic search across all documents
app.post('/search', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { query, limit = 10, category } = req.body;

    if (!query) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: 'Search query is required',
      });
    }

    const startTime = Date.now();

    // Execute semantic search using vector similarity
    const results = await documentService.searchDocuments(query, limit, category);

    const searchTime = Date.now() - startTime;

    res.json({
      query,
      results,
      count: results.length,
      search_time_ms: searchTime,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error searching documents:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: 'Search failed',
      message: error.message,
    });
  }
});

// Get a specific document by ID
app.get('/documents/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const document = await documentService.getDocumentById(parseInt(id));

    if (!document) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Document not found' });
    }

    res.json(document);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error getting document:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: 'Failed to get document',
      message: error.message,
    });
  }
});

// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Test database connection
    await documentService.pool.query('SELECT 1');
    res.json({ status: 'healthy', database: 'connected' });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ status: 'unhealthy', database: 'disconnected' });
  }
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Semantic search service running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

This API provides clean, RESTful endpoints for our semantic search functionality. The `/search` endpoint is the heart of the system, it takes natural language queries and returns semantically relevant documents, even when there are no exact keyword matches.

Notice how we measure and return the search time. This helps you monitor performance as your document collection grows.

## Testing the semantic search system

With our API in place, now let's test our semantic search system to see how it finds relevant documents based on meaning rather than exact keywords. We'll add sample documents and run various search queries.

Create a test script to populate your database with sample content and test the search functionality:

```javascript
// test-search.js
const axios = require('axios');

const baseURL = 'http://localhost:3000';

async function testSemanticSearch() {
  try {
    console.log('Adding sample documents to test semantic search...\n');

    // Add diverse sample documents across different topics
    const sampleDocuments = [
      {
        title: 'Getting Started with Machine Learning',
        content:
          'Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. This guide covers the basics of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and neural networks.',
        category: 'technology',
      },
      {
        title: 'Healthy Cooking Tips',
        content:
          "Eating nutritious meals doesn't have to be complicated. Focus on fresh ingredients, reduce processed foods, and try cooking methods like steaming and grilling. Meal prep can save time and help maintain a balanced diet.",
        category: 'health',
      },
      {
        title: 'Remote Work Best Practices',
        content:
          'Working from home requires discipline and good habits. Set up a dedicated workspace, maintain regular hours, and use collaboration tools effectively. Communication with team members is crucial for remote success.',
        category: 'productivity',
      },
      {
        title: 'Understanding Neural Networks',
        content:
          'Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information. Deep learning uses multi-layered neural networks to solve complex problems.',
        category: 'technology',
      },
    ];

    // Add each document to the system
    for (const doc of sampleDocuments) {
      await axios.post(`${baseURL}/documents`, doc);
      console.log(`✓ Added: ${doc.title}`);
    }

    console.log('\nDocuments added successfully! Now testing semantic search...\n');

    // Test semantic searches that don't use exact keywords
    const testQueries = [
      'artificial intelligence and computers', // Should find ML and neural network docs
      'how to stay healthy while eating', // Should find cooking tips
      'working from home effectively', // Should find remote work practices
      'deep learning algorithms', // Should find both AI-related documents
    ];

    // Run each test query and display results
    for (const query of testQueries) {
      console.log(`🔍 Searching for: "${query}"`);

      const response = await axios.post(`${baseURL}/search`, {
        query,
        limit: 3,
      });

      const { results, search_time_ms } = response.data;

      console.log(`   Found ${results.length} results in ${search_time_ms}ms`);

      // Display the most relevant results
      results.forEach((doc, index) => {
        console.log(`   ${index + 1}. ${doc.title} (similarity: ${doc.similarity_score})`);
        console.log(`      Category: ${doc.category}`);
        console.log(`      Preview: ${doc.preview}\n`);
      });

      console.log('---\n');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Test failed:', error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
}

// Start the server and run tests
console.log('Make sure your server is running with: node server.js\n');
testSemanticSearch();
```

Install `axios` for the test script and run it:

```bash
npm install axios

# Start your server in one terminal
node server.js

# Run the test in another terminal
node test-search.js
```

You should see output showing how the semantic search finds relevant documents even when the search terms don't appear exactly in the document text.

For example, searching for "artificial intelligence and computers" should return documents about machine learning and neural networks, demonstrating the power of semantic understanding.

The similarity scores help you understand how closely each result matches the query - scores closer to 1.0 indicate higher semantic similarity.

## Performance optimization

As your document collection grows, you'll want to optimize performance.

First, let's properly configure the pgvector indexes. The default index settings work for small datasets, but you'll need to tune them for larger collections:

```sql
-- Drop existing indexes to recreate with optimal settings
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS documents_embedding_idx;

-- Create optimized indexes based on your data size
-- Rule of thumb: lists = rows / 1000, with minimum of 10
CREATE INDEX documents_embedding_idx ON documents
USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);  -- Adjust based on your document count

-- Update table statistics for optimal query planning
ANALYZE documents;
```

These indexes dramatically improve query speed by creating approximate nearest neighbor searches instead of comparing every vector.

The `lists` parameter should be adjusted based on your data size, more documents need more lists for optimal performance.

## Conclusion

You now should have a solid foundation for a semantic search system that uses AI embeddings alongside `pgvector` in Neon.

You've built a simple semantic search system that demonstrates the power of AI embeddings with Neon and `pgvector`.

The foundation you've built can be extended with features like real-time search suggestions or multilingual support. The principles of semantic search and vector similarity will enable you to create intelligent applications that understand user intent and context.
