In today's AI-driven world, the ability to connect intelligent agents with powerful tools is key to building sophisticated applications. Imagine AI agents that can not only think and plan but also seamlessly interact with your database to retrieve information, manage resources, and perform complex tasks. This guide explores exactly that, demonstrating how to harness the power of **CrewAI** for agent orchestration, **Composio** for tool integration, and **Neon API** for database management.

Composio acts as a crucial bridge, empowering your CrewAI agents with the ability to interact directly with the Neon API. This integration unlocks a range of possibilities, from querying your Neon project details to managing your database infrastructure programmatically through AI. By leveraging Composio's wide range of tools, you can equip your AI agents with a comprehensive suite of actions, all without needing to wrestle with complex API integrations manually.

This guide provides a practical, hands-on approach to building an AI agent capable of retrieving information from your Neon account. You'll not only see how easily these technologies integrate but also gain a foundational understanding of how to extend this setup for more advanced AI-driven database interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Python 3.7 or higher:** This guide uses Python. If you don't have it already, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Neon account and API Key:**

  - Sign up for a free Neon account at [neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech/signup).
  - Once signed up, you can find your Neon API Key [here](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/profile). You'll need this key to authenticate your application with Neon.

- **Composio account and API Key:**

  - Create a Composio account by visiting [composio.dev](https://composio.dev/).
  - After signing up and logging in, your Composio API key will be available in your [Composio dashboard](https://app.composio.dev/dashboard). You will need this to authenticate your application.

- **OpenAI account and API Key:**
  - This guide uses `gpt-4o-mini` from OpenAI to power the AI agent. If you don't have one, sign up for an account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/).
  - Create a new API key in the [OpenAI Platform API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). This key will allow CrewAI to interact with OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

Once these prerequisites in place, you'll be ready to follow the guide and build your AI agent.

## Building your AI Agent to interact with Neon API

Now, let's dive into building your AI agent that can interact with Neon API using CrewAI and Composio. We'll go through each step, from setting up your project to running your first agent.

### Project structure

For this guide, we'll keep the project structure simple. Create a directory for your project, for example `neon-composio-crewai`, and inside it, you'll have the following files:

    ```bash
    mkdir neon-composio-crewai
    ```

    ```bash
    neon-composio-crewai/
    ├── main.py         # Main Python script to run the AI agent
    ├── requirements.txt # Lists Python dependencies
    ├── .env            # Your environment variables
    ```

### Setting up a virtual environment

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using `venv`:

    ```bash
    cd neon-composio-crewai
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # on Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

### Installing required libraries

Next, you need to install the necessary Python libraries for this project. Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory and add the following lines:

    ```
    composio-crewai
    crewai
    python-dotenv
    ```

Then, install the libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuring API Keys in `.env`

Create a new file named `.env` in your project directory and add the following lines:

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY = YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
    COMPOSIO_API_KEY = YOUR_COMPOSIO_API_KEY
    NEON_API_KEY = YOUR_NEON_API_KEY
    ```

**Replace the placeholders** `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `YOUR_COMPOSIO_API_KEY`, and `YOUR_NEON_API_KEY` with your actual API keys that you obtained in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

<Admonition type="note">
    Make sure you have added `.env` to your `.gitignore` file if you are using Git. This prevents your API keys from being accidentally committed to your code repository.
</Admonition>

### Creating the `main.py` file

Create a new file named `main.py` in your project root directory and paste the following code into it:

    ```python
    import os

    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
    from composio_crewai import ComposioToolSet, App
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()

    toolset = ComposioToolSet()

    # To connect to Neon, either create a new connection or use an existing one configured in your Composio dashboard (Apps -> Integrations).
    # You can comment out the connection creation if you have already created a connection in the dashboard.
    connection = toolset.initiate_connection(
        app=App.NEON, connected_account_params={"api_key": os.getenv("NEON_API_KEY")}
    )

    tools = toolset.get_tools(actions=["NEON_GET_CURRENT_USER_INFORMATION"])

    # Define agent
    crewai_agent = Agent(
        role="Assistant",
        goal="""You are an AI agent that is responsible for taking actions based on the tools you have""",
        backstory=(
            "You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions based on the tools you have"
        ),
        verbose=True,
        tools=tools,
        llm="gpt-4o-mini",
    )

    task = Task(
        description="List me my neon current user details",
        agent=crewai_agent,
        expected_output="All important details of the current user in a single sentence.",
    )

    my_crew = Crew(agents=[crewai_agent], tasks=[task])

    result = my_crew.kickoff()
    print(result)
    ```

Let's break down what this python script does step by step:

### Import necessary libraries and load environment variables

    ```python
    import os

    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
    from composio_crewai import ComposioToolSet, App
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()
    ```

Just like any Python script, we start by importing the necessary libraries. In this case, we import the CrewAI library, the Composio CrewAI library, and the `load_dotenv` function from the `python-dotenv` library. We also call `load_dotenv()` to load environment variables from the `.env` file.

### Initialize `ComposioToolSet`

    ```python
    toolset = ComposioToolSet()
    ```

    This creates an instance of `ComposioToolSet`, which is the main entry point to interact with Composio tools from CrewAI.

### Initiate connection to Neon

    ```python
    connection = toolset.initiate_connection(
        app=App.NEON, connected_account_params={"api_key": os.getenv("NEON_API_KEY")}
    )
    ```

    - `toolset.initiate_connection(...)` initiates a connection to a specific app in Composio.
    - `app=App.NEON` specifies that the connection is for the Neon app.
    - `connected_account_params={"api_key": os.getenv("NEON_API_KEY")}` provides the Neon API key for authentication. This API key is retrieved from your environment variables.

<Admonition type="note">
    If you have already set up a Neon connection in your [Composio dashboard](https://app.composio.dev/integrations), you can comment out these lines. The existing connection will be used automatically when you specify the app in the toolset methods. However, for the guide, we are showing how to establish a connection programmatically.
</Admonition>

### Retrieve tools

    ```python
    tools = toolset.get_tools(actions=["NEON_GET_CURRENT_USER_INFORMATION"])
    ```

    - `toolset.get_tools(actions=[...])` fetches the specified tools (actions) from the Composio toolset.
    - `actions=["NEON_GET_CURRENT_USER_INFORMATION"]` indicates that we want to use the `NEON_GET_CURRENT_USER_INFORMATION` action, which retrieves your Neon user details. This action is part of the Neon toolset in Composio.

### Define the AI Agent

    ```python
    crewai_agent = Agent(
        role="Assistant",
        goal="""You are an AI agent that is responsible for taking actions based on the tools you have""",
        backstory=(
            "You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions based on the tools you have"
        ),
        verbose=True,
        tools=tools,
        llm="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
    ```

This code defines a CrewAI agent named `crewai_agent`.

- `role`, `goal`, `backstory`: These attributes define the agent's identity and purpose.
- `verbose=True`: Enables detailed output from the agent, useful for debugging and understanding the agent's thought process.
- `tools=tools`: Assigns the Composio Neon tools we retrieved in the previous step to this agent. The agent can now use these tools to perform actions.
- `llm="gpt-4o-mini"`: Specifies that the agent will use the `gpt-4o-mini` language model from OpenAI.

### Define the Task

    ```python
    task = Task(
        description="List me my neon current user details",
        agent=crewai_agent,
        expected_output="All important details of the current user in a single sentence.",
    )
    ```

This creates a task for the agent to perform.

- `description`: Describes the task for the agent: "List me my neon current user details".
- `agent=crewai_agent`: Assigns the task to the `crewai_agent` we defined.
- `expected_output`: (Optional) Specifies the desired output format for the task.

### Create and run the Crew

    ```python
    my_crew = Crew(agents=[crewai_agent], tasks=[task])

    result = my_crew.kickoff()
    print(result)
    ```

    - `my_crew = Crew(...)`: Creates a CrewAI crew with the defined agents and tasks.
    - `result = my_crew.kickoff()`: Starts the crew execution. The agent will now execute the assigned task.
    - `print(result)`: Prints the result returned by the agent after completing the task. This will be the Neon user information.

### Running the example

Now that you have set up your project, installed dependencies, and configured your API keys, you are ready to run the example

In your terminal, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This command will:

- Run the `main.py` Python script.
- The script will connect to Composio and Neon using your provided API keys.
- It will create a CrewAI agent.
- The agent will use the `NEON_GET_CURRENT_USER_INFORMATION` Composio tool action to retrieve your Neon user information.
- Finally, it will print the retrieved user information in your terminal.

### Expected output

After running `python main.py`, you should see the information about your Neon user printed in the terminal! The output will look something like this:

![Example output](/docs/guides/composio-crewai-neon-example-output.png)

**Congratulations!** You have successfully built and run an AI agent that can interact with your Neon account using CrewAI and Composio!

## Explore Further Neon Actions

The Composio Neon tool provides a wide range of actions you can use to manage your Neon projects. The example we just ran used the `NEON_GET_CURRENT_USER_INFORMATION` action to retrieve your user details. You can modify the `main.py` script to experiment with other actions. For example, to get a list of your Neon projects, you would change the `actions` list in `toolset.get_tools(...)` to:

```python
tools = toolset.get_tools(actions=["NEON_RETRIEVE_PROJECTS_LIST"])
```

and update the task description accordingly.

Here's a list of all the available actions that you can use with the Neon Composio tool:

To effectively use the wide array of Neon actions available through Composio, it's important to understand that **each action may require specific input parameters**. These parameters are essential for Composio to correctly execute the desired operation against your Neon account.

You can find detailed information about each action, including its required parameters and their descriptions under [Neon app in your Composio dashboard](https://app.composio.dev/app/neon)

**To utilize actions that require parameters, you simply need to include these parameters within the `description` of the task you assign to your CrewAI agent.** The agent will intelligently extract these parameters from the task description when it uses the Composio tool.

For instance, let's consider the `NEON_GET_PROJECT_CONNECTION_URI` action.

![Composio Neon Get Connection URI Action](/docs/guides/composio-neon-get-connection-uri-action.png)

This action needs the `project_id`, `database_name`, and `role_name` to retrieve the correct connection string. Here's how you would define a task to use this action, embedding the necessary parameters directly in the task description:

```python
get_connection_string_task = Task(
    description="Get the connection string for the Neon project with ID 'crimson-sea-41647396', for the database named 'neondb', using the role 'neondb_owner'.",
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="The Neon connection string.",
)
```

In this example, the task description clearly provides all the necessary information for the `NEON_GET_PROJECT_CONNECTION_URI` action. When the `crewai_agent` executes this task, it will understand from the description which action to use and what parameters are needed, making it seamless to interact with more complex Neon functionalities through your AI agents. Remember to tailor your task descriptions to accurately reflect the parameters needed for the specific Neon action you intend to use.

## Summary

In this guide, we've successfully built an AI agent capable of interacting with your Neon API using CrewAI and Composio. We covered the following steps:

- Setting up your development environment with Python and installing the necessary libraries (`crewai`, `composio-crewai`, `python-dotenv`).
- Configuring your API keys for Neon, Composio, and OpenAI.
- Creating the script to define your AI agent, establish a connection to Neon via Composio, and execute a task using the `NEON_GET_CURRENT_USER_INFORMATION` action.
- Running the example script and observing your AI agent successfully retrieve and display your Neon user information.
- Exploring the wide range of available Neon actions within the Composio toolset, understanding how to extend your AI agent's capabilities.

As a next step, consider expanding your AI agent's capabilities by utilizing more of the available Neon actions. Imagine automating project creation using `NEON_CREATE_PROJECT_WITH_QUOTA_AND_SETTINGS`, programmatically retrieving database connection URIs with `NEON_GET_PROJECT_CONNECTION_URI`, and then using a Postgres library of your choice to execute database queries. This opens the door to building sophisticated AI-driven workflows for database management, data analysis, and countless other applications tailored to your specific needs.

You can find the source code for the application described in this guide on GitHub.
