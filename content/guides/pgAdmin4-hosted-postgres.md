## Setting Up pgAdmin4

1. **Download and Install pgAdmin4**: If you haven't already, download pgAdmin4 from the [official website](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Launch pgAdmin4**: Open pgAdmin4 from your applications menu or web browser.

## Provisioning a Serverless Postgres

To get started, go to the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) and enter the name of your choice as the project name.

All Neon connection strings have the following format:

```bash
postgres://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>.neon.tech:<port>/<dbname>
```

- `user` is the database user.
- `password` is the database user’s password.
- `endpoint_hostname` is the host with neon.tech as the [TLD](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/top-level-domain/).
- `port` is the Neon port number. The default port number is 5432.
- `dbname` is the name of the database. “neondb” is the default database created with each Neon project.
- `?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require` optional query parameters that enforce the [SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/) mode and channel binding while connecting to the Postgres instance for better security.

You will be using these connecting string components further in the guide. Proceed further in this guide to connect pgAdmin4 to your Postgres.
