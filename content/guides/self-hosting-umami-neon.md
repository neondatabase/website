In this guide, you will learn how to self host your Umami analytics instance on Fly.io¬†and powered by Neon Postgres as the serverless database.

## Prerequisites

To follow along and deploy the application in this guide, you will need the following:

- [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/) ‚Äì A command-line utility that lets you work with the Fly.io platform. You will also need [a fly.io account](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/sign-up/).
- [A Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/signup) ‚Äì The self-hosted Umami analytics instance will connect to a Neon serverless Postgres database üöÄ

## Steps

## What is Umami?

![Umami Analytics Preview](/guides/images/self-hosting-umami-neon/umami.jpeg)

Umami is a simple, fast, privacy-focused, open-source analytics solution. Umami is a better alternative to Google Analytics because it gives you total control of your data and does not violate the privacy of your users. <sup>[[1](https://umami.is/docs)]</sup>

## Provisioning a Postgres Database using Neon

Using a serverless Postgres database powered by Neon allows you to scale down to zero when the database is not being used, which saves on compute costs.
.

To get started, go to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) and enter a name for your project.

You will be presented with a dialog that provides a connection string of your database. Enable the **Connection pooling** toggle for a pooled connection string.

![](/guides/images/self-hosting-umami-neon/1689d44f-4c5d-4b2a-8d13-32407f9c8781.png)

All Neon connection strings have the following format:

```bash
postgres://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>.neon.tech:<port>/<dbname>
```

- `user` is the database user.
- `password` is the database user‚Äôs password.
- `endpoint_hostname` is the host with neon.tech as the [top level domain (TLD)](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/top-level-domain/).
- `port` is the Neon port number. The default port number is 5432.
- `dbname` is the name of the database. ‚Äúneondb‚Äù is the default database created with each Neon project if you don't specify your own database name.
- `?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require` are optional query parameters that enforce the [SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/) mode and channel binding for better security when connecting to the Postgres instance.

Please save the connection string somewhere safe. Later, you will use it to configure the `DATABASE_URL` variable.

## Setup Umami analytics instance for Fly.io

To self host your Umami analytics instance, you'll use [Umami's pre-built Docker container for Postgres](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/pkgs/container/umami/157800125?tag=postgresql-latest). This will allow you to self host an Umami analytics instance on Fly.io with a single `fly.toml` file.

In your terminal window, execute the following commands to create a new directory and `cd` to it:

```bash
mkdir self-host-umami-neon
cd self-host-umami-neon
```

In the directory `self-host-umami-neon`, create a file named `fly.toml` with the following content:

```toml
# File: fly.toml

kill_signal = "SIGINT"
kill_timeout = "5s"

[experimental]
    auto_rollback = true

[build]
    image = "ghcr.io/umami-software/umami:postgresql-latest"

[[services]]
    protocol = "tcp"
    internal_port = 3000
    processes = ["app"]

[[services.ports]]
    port = 80
    handlers = ["http"]
    force_https = true

[[services.ports]]
    port = 443
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]

[services.concurrency]
    type = "connections"
    hard_limit = 25
    soft_limit = 20

[[services.tcp_checks]]
    interval = "15s"
    timeout = "2s"
    grace_period = "1s"
```

In the `build` property named `image`, you will see that it's pointing to the latest Postgres compatible pre-built Docker image of Umami.

Next, you need to create an app on Fly.io using the configuration present in `fly.toml` file. In your terminal window, execute the following command to launch a Fly.io app:

```bash
fly launch
```

When prompted by the CLI to allow copying of the existing configuration into a new app, answer with a `y`:

```bash
An existing fly.toml file was found
? Would you like to copy its configuration to the new app? Yes
```

Optional: When asked if you want to tweak the default settings, answer with a `y`:

```bash
Using build strategies '[the "ghcr.io/umami-software/umami:postgresql-latest" docker image]'. Remove [build] from fly.toml to force a rescan
Creating app in /Users/rishi/Desktop/test
We're about to launch your app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:

Organization: Rishi Raj Jain         (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         test                   (derived from your directory name)
Region:       Mumbai, India          (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)
Postgres:     <none>                 (not requested)
Redis:        <none>                 (not requested)

? Do you want to tweak these settings before proceeding? Yes
Opening https://fly.io/cli/launch/641f1a1d67950614e4e92820ba484310 ...
```

flyctl will then automatically take you to a web page, which allows you to visually edit the default settings. For example, you can change the app name to `self-host-umami-neon`, and change the region to say `ams`.

Click on `Confirm Settings` to set this configuration, and go back to your terminal window. In your terminal window, you should now see output similar to the following:

```bash
Waiting for launch data... Done
Created app 'self-host-umami-neon' in organization 'personal'
Admin URL: https://fly.io/apps/self-host-umami-neon
Hostname: self-host-umami-neon.fly.dev

Watch your deployment at https://fly.io/apps/self-host-umami-neon/monitoring

Provisioning ips for self-host-umami-neon
  Dedicated ipv6: 2a09:8280:1::2b:b52c:0
  Shared ipv4: 66.241.124.197
  Add a dedicated ipv4 with: fly ips allocate-v4

This deployment will:
 * create 2 "app" machines
```

Once the deployment is ready, you are left with just one step &#8212; to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable that we obtained in the previous section. We'll do that in the next section.

## Configure Neon Postgres as serverless database for self-hosted Umami analytics

In your Fly.io [Dashboard > Apps](https://fly.io/dashboard), click on your app name, and you will be taken to the overview of your app on Fly.io.

![](/guides/images/self-hosting-umami-neon/307262264-17f870e2-379f-4d80-b37e-6dac9075174c.png)

Click on `Secrets` in the left sidebar, and then click on `New Secret` on the top right corner to start creating an environment variable for your app.

![](/guides/images/self-hosting-umami-neon/307263442-b835f320-8ae8-4a8a-a4f0-dbeb9e07530f.png)

In the modal, set the name of the secret as `DATABASE_URL`, and set the `Secret` value to be the one that we obtained in the previous section. Click **Set secret** to save the environment variable.

![](/guides/images/self-hosting-umami-neon/307263972-75bef039-f4d1-4b7d-a66d-dd312290a6d1.png)

Great! With that done, you have succesfully ensured that each deployment of your app on Fly.io will have the database URL pointing to the Neon Postgres instance. Let's trigger a deploy to see it all in action.

## Deploy To Fly.io

You can now deploy your app to Fly by running the following command:

```bash
flyctl deploy
```

Once deployed, you will be able to log into your self hosted Umami analytics instance with the default credentials, i.e.; **admin** as the username & **umami** as the password. You will then be able to create new websites and analyze the traffic to those sites.

## Summary

In this guide, you learned how to run your own Umami analytics instance for analytics with Fly.io, powered by Neon postgres as your database.
