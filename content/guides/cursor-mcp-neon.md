Imagine adjusting your database schema simply by describing the change in plain English. This is possible by combining [Cursor](https://cursor.com) with the [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).

This guide demonstrates how to use [Cursor's Composer](https://docs.cursor.com/composer) and Neon's MCP server to perform database migrations in your Neon project.

## Key components

Let's break down the key components in this setup:

- **Cursor**: Cursor is an AI-first code editor that supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) for interfacing with external tools (APIs, databases, etc.)

- **Neon MCP Server**: Neon's MCP server acts as a bridge between MCP clients like Cursor and [Neon's API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), letting you work with Neon databases using natural language commands.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: MCP is a lightweight communication standard that allows Cursor and Neon MCP Server to work together.

## Setting up Neon MCP Server in Cursor

The following steps show how to set up Neon MCP Server in Cursor.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Cursor Editor:** Download and install Cursor from [cursor.com](https://cursor.com).
2.  **A Neon Account and Project:** You'll need a Neon account and a project. You can quickly create a new Neon project here [pg.new](https://pg.new)
3.  **Neon API Key:** After signing up, get your Neon API Key from the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/profile). This API key is needed to authenticate your application with Neon. For instructions, see [Manage API keys](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys).

    <Admonition type="warning" title="Neon API Key Security">
    Keep your Neon API key secure, and never share it publicly. It provides access to your Neon projects.
    </Admonition>

4.  **Node.js (>= v18) and npm:** Ensure Node.js (version 18 or later) and npm are installed. Download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation and Configuration

**Add Neon MCP Server to Cursor:**

1. Open Cursor and go to **Cursor Settings** in the Navbar.
1. In Settings, navigate to **Features**.

   Cursor will attempt to connect. Your new "Neon" MCP server should appear in the MCP Servers list with all the available tools.

   ![Cursor with Neon MCP Tools](/docs/guides/cursor-with-neon-mcp-tools.png)

   You've now configured Neon MCP Server in Cursor and can manage your Neon Postgres databases using AI.

1. Open the Cursor **Composer** view using the keyboard shortcut **Command + I** (on Mac) or **Control + I** (on Windows).

   ![Cursor Composer view](/docs/guides/cursor_composer_view.png)

1. Type `List your available MCP tools` in the Composer text field, select the **agent** option in the corner of the field, and click **Submit**.

   **_Note: The agent option here is tiny and easy to miss!_**

   ![Cursor list available tools](/docs/guides/cursor_list_tools.png)

1. Try out an Neon MCP Server tool by typing `Tell me about my Neon project <project_id>`. **You'll need to provide your Neon project ID.**

   ![Cursor list project details](/docs/guides/cursor_project_details.png)

   Cursor uses the Neon MCP Server `describe_project` tool to retrieve your project's details.

## Neon MCP Server Tools

Neon MCP server exposes the following actions, which primarily map to **Neon API endpoints**:

- `list_projects`: Lists all your Neon projects. This uses the Neon API to retrieve a summary of all projects associated with your Neon account. **_Note: This particular action is still under development. It's not yet listing projects as expected._**
- `describe_project`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific Neon project. Provides comprehensive details about a chosen project, such as its ID, name, and associated branches.
- `create_project`: Creates a new Neon project — a container in Neon for branches, databases, roles, and computes.
- `delete_project`: Deletes an existing Neon project.
- `create_branch`: Creates a new branch within a Neon project. Leverages Neon's branching feature, allowing you to create new branches for development or migrations.
- `delete_branch`: Deletes an existing branch in a Neon project.
- `describe_branch`: Retrieves details about a specific branch. Retrieves information about a particular branch, such as its name and ID.
- `run_sql`: Runs a single SQL query against a Neon database. Allows you to run read or write SQL queries.
- `run_sql_transaction`: Runs a series of SQL queries within a transaction against a Neon database. Enables running multiple SQL statements as a single atomic transaction, ensuring data consistency.
- `get_database_tables`: Lists all tables in a specified Neon database. Provides a list of tables.
- `describe_table_schema`: Retrieves the schema definition of a specific table. Details the structure of a table, including columns and data types.
- `prepare_database_migration`: Initiates a database migration process, utilizing a temporary branch for safety. Begins the process of altering your database schema, safely using Neon's branching feature.
- `complete_database_migration`: Completes a migration process, applying changes to your main database and cleaning up temporary resources.

These actions enable any MCP client like Cursor to interact with various functionalities of the **Neon platform via the Neon API.** Certain tools, especially database migration ones, are tailored for AI agent and LLM usage, leveraging Neon’s branching for safe preview and commit.

## Development Workflow: Adding a Column with Cursor and Neon MCP

Let's walk through a typical development scenario: Quickly adding a column for prototyping using natural language within Cursor. The following chat log demonstrates a real interaction with Cursor and the Neon MCP server.

**Scenario:** During development, you decide to track timestamps for entries in your `playing_with_neon` table. You want to quickly add a `created_at` column.

Check out the video below to see how Cursor and Neon MCP Server can help you add a new column to your database table using natural language commands.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Security Reminder">
For your security, review the tool's purpose before permitting the operation to proceed. Remember that LLMs can sometimes produce unexpected results, so careful monitoring is always recommended.
</Admonition>

Here's the conversation log between the user and Cursor:

```
User: In my neon project id: round-salad-44063611 list all the tables
Cursor: I'll help you list all the tables in your Neon project. I'll use the default database name 'neondb' since none was specified.
> Called MCP Tool (get_database_tables)
> I found one table in your database:
> playing_with_neon (in the public schema)
> Would you like to see more details about this table's structure or perform any other operations with it?

User: Can you show me first 5 rows?
Cursor: I'll query the first 5 rows from the playing_with_neon table.
> Called MCP Tool (run_sql)
> Here are the first 5 rows from the table. The table has three columns:
> id (sequential numbers)
> name (string values)
> value (decimal numbers)
> Would you like to perform any other operations with this data?

User: can you add a created_at column?
Cursor: I'll help you add a created_at column to the playing_with_neon table. I'll set it up with a timestamp data type and set it to automatically record the creation time of new rows.
> Called MCP Tool (prepare_database_migration)
> Let me verify the change in the temporary branch to make sure it was applied correctly.
> Called MCP Tool (run_sql)
> I've added the created_at column to the playing_with_neon table in a temporary branch. Would you like to commit this migration to the main branch?
> Migration Details:
> Migration ID: a65babcd-d1cc-401f-89b5-762570570102
> Temporary Branch Name: br-silent-cherry-a1eqrl6i
> Temporary Branch ID: br-silent-cherry-a1eqrl6i
> Migration Result: Success
> Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with applying this change to the main branch.

User: yeah do it
Cursor: I'll complete the migration and apply the changes to the main branch.
> Called MCP Tool (complete_database_migration)
> The migration has been successfully completed! The created_at column has been added to your table in the main branch, and the temporary branch has been cleaned up.
```

**Key takeaways:**

- **Natural language interaction:** You can use simple, conversational English to interact with your database.
- **Step-by-step guidance:** Cursor (Claude) confirms each step and provides details like branch names and migration IDs.
- **MCP Tools in Action:** The underlying MCP tools (`get_database_tables`, `run_sql`, `prepare_database_migration`, `complete_database_migration`) illustrate the automated process.
- **Branching for safety:** The agent automatically creates a temporary branch for schema changes. The user will be prompted to confirm the migration before applying it to the main branch.

You can verify the changes in your Neon Console or by querying the database directly.

<Admonition type="note">
While the Neon MCP server allows you to utilize all of Neon's functionalities, you can also use a [generic Postgres MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres) to connect to Neon.

## Bonus: Creating a project and branch

Beyond schema changes, you can also manage your Neon projects and branches directly within Cursor using natural language commands. This can be useful for quickly setting up a new development or test environment.

### Creating a new project

Let's say you want to create a new Neon project named "my-new-project". You can simply tell Cursor:

```
User: Create a Neon project named "my-new-project"
Cursor: I'll help you create a new Neon project with the specified name.
> Called MCP Tool (create_project)
> Great! I've created a new Neon project for you with the name "my-new-project". Here are the important details:
> Project ID: orange-dawn-33739962
> Default branch: main
> Default database: neondb
> The project is ready to use. You can start creating tables and working with your database right away.
```

![Cursor creating a new Neon project](/docs/guides/cursor-mcp-create-new-project.png)

Cursor will then use the `create_project` MCP tool to initiate the project creation. It will provide you with a project ID and name.

### Creating a New Branch

Once you have a project, you can easily create new branches for development or experimentation. For example, to create a branch named "feature-x" in your "my-new-project" project:

```
User: Create a branch named "feature-x"
Cursor: Perfect! I've created a new branch named "feature-x". Here are the details:
> Branch ID: br-cold-mountain-a523ka2w
> Branch name: feature-x
> Parent branch ID: br-odd-pine-a5y53krm
> The branch has been created successfully and is ready for use.
```

![Cursor creating a new Neon branch](/docs/guides/cursor-mcp-create-new-branch.png)

Cursor will use the `create_branch` MCP tool to create the branch and provide you with the branch name and ID. Notice how we don't need to specify the project ID, as Cursor remembers the active project context.

## Conclusion

Cursor with Neon MCP Server lets you use natural language to interact with your database and take advantage of Neon's branching capabilities for fast iteration. This approach is ideal for quickly testing database ideas and making schema changes during development.
