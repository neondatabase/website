## Summary

Three features make Postgres on Neon a solid foundation for teams building SaaS applications:

<DefinitionList bulletType="check">
Database branching
: Create ephemeral environments with production-like copies of your data and schema for end-to-end testing, development, and previews.

Autoscaling
: CPU, Memory, and storage scale up and down to match your workload. No more manual resizes or paying for resources you don't need.

Serverless
: Never touch a `pg_hba.conf`, or SSH into anywhere. In Neon, operational work is either abstracted away or presented in an intuitive UI + API.
</DefinitionList>

**The result:**
Teams ship faster and more efficiently, with less risk of outage during times that matter most.

<Testimonial

## Key features

### Database branching

A branch in Neon is a copy-on-write clone of your database. Branches include both schema and data. Teams use them to create ephemeral environments for development, testing, and preview environments.

- **Branch creation is instant** - Independent of DB size. Storage is not duplicated for each branch.
- **Branches are cost-efficient** - You can deploy thousands of branches for $19 /month.
- **Branch compute can scale to zero when idle** - to further reduce cost.

How branches can be used to increase development velocity:
<DefinitionList bulletType="check">
Onboard Faster, Keep Collaboration in Sync
: Give each developer on your team their own branch for local development. They can use [branch reset](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore) to instantly restore and catch up with the latest changes.

One Branch per PR
: Use automation to give each git branch or Pull Request a corresponding database branch. This can be done with automation tools like GitHub Actions, or more easily as part of an integration:
: - [Neon GitHub integration](/docs/guides/neon-github-integration) - An easier way to create a branch for every PR.
: - [Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel) - Create and integrate a branch into every Vercel Preview deployment.

Ephemeral Environments for Dev/Test
: Deploy confidently by using branches to run your test suite on an exact copy of your production database. No handling of seed data, no manual work keeping environments in sync.

### Autoscaling

Neon dynamically adjusts the amount of resources allocated to your database in response to the current load, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

<DefinitionList bulletType="check">
Performance w/ cost-efficiency
: Your CPU/memory automatically scale up during traffic spikes. When you no longer need the extra resources, your database scales down.

No manual resizes for compute or storage
: Other platforms require downtime for resizes, limit the frequency of resizes, and don't let you scale storage down. On Neon everything is automated and instant.

Performance for high connections  
: Neon has pbBouncer built-in at no extra cost. Use pooling and keep scaling.
</DefinitionList>

### Serverless

Neon abstracts away the concept of servers so that you can focus on building your SaaS, not managing your database.

- No compute/storage management: With Neon you don’t need to provision, maintain, resize, or administer servers.
- Managed infrastructure: Neon handles all underlying infrastructure, including security patches, load balancing, and capacity planning.
- Built-in availability and fault tolerance: Neon has multi-AZ storage redundancy and rapid recovery built-in.

## Database-per-tenant SaaS

If your SaaS project could benefit from multitenancy, Neon makes it simple to create a dedicated database for each user:

- **Instant deployment**: Neon projects are created in milliseconds via APIs.
- **No pre-provisioning**: You can scale your architecture progressively, from a few tenants to thousands.
- **Pay per usage**: You only pay for the tenants that are actively running.
