title: Neon Auth for Vercel previews and custom data anonymization rules
---

## One command to set up your AI-powered database workflow

The `neon init` command now configures both the Neon MCP Server and the Neon VS Code Extension in a single step:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init
```

This command authenticates via OAuth, creates a Neon API key, and sets up:

- **Neon MCP Server** — Lets AI assistants manage your Neon projects, branches, and databases through natural language commands
- **Neon VS Code Extension** — Brings database schema browsing, SQL editing, and table data management directly into your IDE

Previously introduced as separate features (MCP Server setup [in December](/changelog/2025-12-19#easier-setup-for-neon-mcp-server) and VS Code Extension [in January](/changelog/2026-01-09#introducing-the-new-neon-vs-code-extension)), you can now get your complete AI-powered database development environment configured with one command in Cursor, VS Code, or Claude Code CLI.

For more information, see [Connect MCP clients to Neon](/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon) and [Get started with the Neon VS Code Extension](/docs/local/vscode-extension).

## Neon Auth now works with Vercel preview deployments

Both the [Vercel-managed](/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration) and [Neon-managed](/docs/guides/neon-managed-vercel-integration) integrations now automatically provision Neon Auth on preview branches when enabled on your production branch. Preview deployments get the `NEON_AUTH_BASE_URL` and `VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL` environment variables configured automatically.

Neon Auth provides managed authentication that stores user profiles in your database. When your database branches, auth data branches with it, making it easy to test authentication in isolated preview environments. [Learn more](/docs/auth/overview).

## Custom rules for data anonymization

[Data anonymization](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization) now supports custom rules via the Neon API. Define masking rules using any PostgreSQL expression or function—like conditional `CASE` statements, custom functions, or combinations of masking functions, giving you flexibility beyond the built-in masking functions for domain-specific anonymization needs.

## New Neon logo

You might notice a new Neon logo across the site, dashboard, and docs. Same Neon. New mark.

The logo is refreshed while staying true to the elephant and N we founded the company with.This update brings our visual identity into the Databricks universe as we continue growing together, helping more than a million developers ship faster with Postgres.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Auth**
  - Added a new [React + Vite example](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-js/tree/main/examples/react-vite-external-ui) demonstrating how to use `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` as an external UI library with Neon Auth. The example includes a complete authentication flow with sign-in, sign-up, forgot password, and account settings, built with React Router and Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui.
  - OAuth provider credentials (client ID and client secret) are now hidden from organization members and collaborators. Only admin users can view these credentials in the Console.

- **Data Anonymization**
  - Foreign key columns can no longer be masked directly to maintain referential consistency. Instead of showing masking rule suggestions, the Console now displays an alert with an action to navigate to the corresponding primary key column. Clicking "Go to primary key" scrolls to and highlights the relevant primary key where you can set masking rules.

- **Data API**
  - Fixed an issue where project-scoped API keys could not read Data API status on organization-owned projects. The endpoint now uses project-level permissions instead of requiring organization-level access.

- **Neon Console**
  - The default branch created with each new project is now named `production` instead of `main`.

- **Monitoring integrations**
  - Error messages returned by Neon's monitoring integrations now display on integration cards on the Integrations page in your Neon project, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot integration issues.

- **Neon MCP Server**
  - Fixed read-only mode detection in OAuth flows. Previously, the `readOnly` flag was hardcoded to `false`, allowing users with OAuth tokens containing only the `read` scope to access write-only tools. Read-only mode now properly restricts access based on OAuth scopes.
  - Added scope selection UI to the OAuth authorization flow, letting users optionally deselect write permissions when authorizing MCP clients.
  - Fixed account resolution when using project-scoped API keys. Previously, project-scoped API keys would cause errors when attempting to access account-level endpoints since these keys are restricted to project-level operations. The MCP server now handles these cases gracefully with fallback account information.
  - Fixed OAuth token verification regression that was causing authentication failures for users who authenticated via OAuth. The server now correctly checks OAuth tokens before falling back to API key verification.
