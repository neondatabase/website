## OpenTelemetry integration

Neon now supports OpenTelemetry! You can send metrics and Postgres logs from Neon to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend. You can enable the integration from the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console. For setup instructions, refer to our [OpenTelemetry docs](/docs/guides/opentelemetry), with example configuration for New Relic.

## Data API now available in beta for all Neon users

The **Neon Data API** is now in open beta for all users. Instantly turn your Neon Postgres database into a REST API. No backend required. Query tables, views, and functions right from your client app using standard HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`), powered by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org).

We've improved our onboarding to make it easier to get Neon Auth and RLS set up as needed to safely use the Data API in your app.

## API key-based authentication for the Neon MCP Server

The Neon MCP Server now supports API key-based authentication for remote access, in addition to OAuth. This allows for simpler authentication using your [Neon API key (personal or organization)](/docs/manage/api-keys) for programmatic access.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Neon": {
      "url": "https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <$NEON_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Neon MCP Server setup instructions, see our [guide](/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon).
