## Weekly Neon usage reports

Paid plan users will soon begin receiving weekly usage reports on Mondays. These reports provide month-to-date usage and costs across all billing metrics—including compute, storage, extra branches, and network transfer—helping you track spending and optimize costs before your monthly bill is finalized.

For cost optimization strategies for Neon, please refer to our [Cost optimization guide](/docs/introduction/cost-optimization).

## pgvector v0.8.1 on Postgres 18

We've added support for [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) v0.8.1 on Postgres 18. This new version of `pgvector` adds support for Postgres 18 and improves `binary_quantize` function performance.

## Manage Neon with Pulumi

[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com), an open-source infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool, can now be used to provision and manage your Neon projects as code. Using familiar programming languages or formats such as TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, Java, or YAML, you can define your Neon projects, branches, databases, compute endpoints, and roles alongside your other cloud resources. This integration uses a community-developed provider bridged from the Terraform provider for Neon.

```javascript
import * as neon from '@pulumi/neon';
```

To get started, see [Manage Neon with Pulumi](/guides/neon-pulumi).

## Manage Neon with SST

You can now use Neon with [SST](https://sst.dev/), an open-source framework for building full-stack applications on your own infrastructure. SST's support for Pulumi and Terraform providers enables you to manage Neon resources directly in your `sst.config.ts` alongside your serverless applications, with automated database provisioning for your deployments.

```bash
npx sst add neon
```

To learn how, see [Manage Neon with SST](/guides/neon-sst).

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon CLI**
  - We updated the Neon CLI to version 2.15.1, which adds support for numeric characters in parent branch names and fixes CSRF authentication errors experienced by some users. To upgrade your Neon CLI version, please refer to our [upgrade instructions](https://neon.com/docs/reference/cli-install#upgrade).
- **Neon API**
  - Fixed an issue where database rename requests through the [Update branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectbranchdatabase) endpoint could fail with a `could not configure compute node` error when the target database had active connections. The database rename operation now drops existing connections to the database before renaming, which allows rename requests to complete successfully.
- **Postgres extension update**
  - The `neon` Postgres extension, which provides functions and views for gathering Neon-specific metrics, has been updated to version 1.9. To learn more about this extension, see [The neon extension](/docs/extensions/neon).
- **Neon Console**
  - Fixed an issue that prevented creating Postgres 18 projects in HIPAA-enabled organizations. Note that HIPAA cannot be enabled on Postgres 18 projects, as Postgres 18 is currently in preview.
- **Snapshot restore**
  - The [multi-step snapshot restore](/docs/guides/backup-restore#multi-step-restore) flow now includes **Restored to** and **Restored from** fields that show the target date/time and source snapshot for the restore operation. At the end of the restore flow, a **Go to branch** button lets you navigate directly to the backup branch created by the restore operation.
