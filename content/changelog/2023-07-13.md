### Fixes & improvements

- Control Plane: The polling interval for a branch deletion operation was decreased from approximately 20 seconds to 1 second. A branch deletion operation typically takes a few seconds but appeared to take longer due to the polling delay.
- UI: Fixed the code example copy button in the **Connection Details** widget, which failed to remain stationary while scrolling.

### Database and role management via SQL

    Neon now supports database and role management via SQL. You can now manage databases and roles from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or an SQL client, such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor). Previously, databases and roles could only be managed in the Neon Console.

    With this change, you can grant and revoke privileges for Postgres roles as you would in a stand-alone Postgres installation.

    Additionally, roles created in the Neon Console, CLI, and API are now automatically granted membership in a `neon_superuser` role. This role defines the privileges required to perform tasks in Neon such as creating databases, roles, and extensions. To learn more, see [The neon_superuser role](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role).

### Improved experience for Prisma Migrate users

    Users of Prisma Migrate no longer need to manually create a shadow database in Neon.

    When using the `prisma migrate dev` command, Prisma Migrate automatically creates and deletes a “shadow” database. This database enables Prisma Migrate to generate new migrations and detect schema drift, ensuring that no manual changes have been made to the development database.

    Previously, running `prisma migrate dev` without manually creating and configuring a shadow database in Neon would return the following error:

    ```text
    Error: A migration failed when applied to the shadow database Database error: Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: permission denied to create database
    ```

    The reason for this error was that it was not possible in Neon to create and delete databases via SQL. To work around this issue, you had to manually create a shadow database in Neon and specify the connection string of that database in your `schema.prisma` file using the `shadowDatabaseUrl` variable. For example:

    ```text
    datasource db {
    provider  = "postgresql"
    url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
    directUrl = env("DIRECT_DATABASE_URL")
    shadowDatabaseUrl = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")
    }
    ```

    With support for managing databases via SQL, this workaround is no longer required. You can now remove the `shadowDatabaseUrl` variable from your `schema.prisma` file.
