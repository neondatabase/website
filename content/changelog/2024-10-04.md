### More projects

Customers with [database-per-tenant](https://neon.tech/use-cases/database-per-tenant), developer platforms, and AI Agents told us they needed more projects: we've expanded the project limits across all paid Neon plans.

New limits:

- **Launch Plan**: Up to 100 projects
- **Scale Plan**: Up to 1,000 projects
- **Business Plan**: Up to 5,000 projects

A reminder, last week we introduced the experimental [@neondatabase/toolkit](https://github.com/neondatabase/toolkit), which allows you to spin up a Postgres database in seconds and run SQL queries &#8212; ideal for quick setups and testing environments, and for taking advantage of your new, higher project limits.

### **ISO27110 & ISO27701 compliance**

These new certifications add to our growing list of compliance achievements. For more about Neon's compliance milestones, see [Compliance](/docs/security/compliance).

### Database limits per branch

In case you missed last week's heads up, but this week we've started enforcing a limit of 500 roles and 500 databases per branch. If you have any concerns about these new limits, please reach out to the Neon Support team. Previously, these limits were recommended but not enforced.

### At a glance metrics for Free plan

We're making it easier for Free Plan users to check how much room you've got left on your account-level metrics. Find it on your Projects page.

And we've also added a project-level usage widget on the Project Dashbaord as well, letting you know your current consumption levels for the month for each individual project.

### Guests are now Collaborators

We've renamed **Project sharing** to **Collaborators** in both your Project and Organization settings pages in the Neon Console. This update streamlines collaboration with other users, whether from a personal account project or with external users for Organization-owned projects.

To manage collaboration from the project level, **Project → Settings → Collaborators**. And to manage collaboration for all projects in your Organization, **Organization → People → Collaborators**.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- We've removed deprecated language and actions from the Neon CLI. A few months ago, we started calling your root branch `default` instead of `primary`. The CLI now reflects this change: `primary` is no more, it's `default` everywhere. For more info, see [set-default](/docs/reference/cli-branches#set-default).
- Added support for organization scopes in Neon OAuth, including create, read, update, delete, and manage organization permissions. See [Neon OAuth integration](/docs/guides/oauth-integration) for details.
- Added an account selector to let users choose between personal and organization accounts when submitting a support ticket. This prevents issues for users with both free and paid accounts.
- Fixed a UI issue where very long parent branch names broke the layout on the Branches view.
- Resolved an issue where paid users incorrectly received alerts for hitting their monthly compute limits.
- Corrected a display issue on the Monitoring page where charts showed an inaccurate pattern of breaks for autoscaling computes.
