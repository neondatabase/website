### At a glance usage metrics for paid plan users

A few weeks ago, we added at-a-glance usage metrics on the Free Plan to help users track account-level usage. This widget is now available on all Neon plans. You can find it on your **Projects** page in the Neon Console.

And we've added a project-level usage widget on the **Project Dashboard** as well, letting you know your current usage levels for the month for each individual project.

And don't forget to check out this week's fixes and improvements:

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Authorize**

  Neon Authorize is now supported on Postgres 17. This recently introduced feature lets you move Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS) policies into your codebase. To learn more, read the [announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/introducing-neon-authorize) or check out the [docs](/docs/guides/neon-authorize).

- **Neon Vercel Integration**

  The Neon Vercel Integration is now supported on Organization-owned projects.

- **Neon API updates**

  We've introduced several new endpoints for managing [Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) in Neon. The new endpoints include:

  - [Get organization details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganization)
  - [Get organization members](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganizationmembers)
  - [Get organization member details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganizationmember)
  - [Get organization invitation details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getorganizationinvitations)
  - [Create organizations invitations](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createorganizationinvitations)

- **Fixes**

  - A previously specified query was not cleared from the **Neon SQL Editor** state after selecting a different query from the **History** list. This caused the previous query to be run instead of the newly selected query when clicking **Run**.
  - Resetting a child branch from an unprotected parent branch regenerated Postgres role passwords on the child branch. Passwords should only be regenerated when the parent branch is defined as a protected branch.
  - Fixed an issue on the **Monitoring** page where lines on the **RAM** and **Working set size** graphs overflowed the graph area.
  - Removed usage alerts from shared Neon projects. The alerts should only appear for project owners.
  - Added validation that prevents an Organization name field from being left blank when creating a new Organization.
  - Fixed an issue with the **psql** `\help` or `\h` commands accessible via the Neon SQL Editor. The specified help page failed to display.

    <Admonition type="tip" title="Did you know?">
    The Neon SQL Editor supports `psql` meta-commands, which act like shortcuts for interacting with your database. If you are already familiar with using meta-commands from the `psql` command-line interface, you can use many of those same commands in the SQL Editor.

    To get a list of supported commands, use `\?`. For more info, see the [meta-commands](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor#meta-commands) section of our [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) docs page.
