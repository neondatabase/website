### Same-region replicas

Neon now supports same-region read replicas. Neon's read replicas are independent read-only compute instances designed to perform read operations on the same data as your read-write computes. You can instantly create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project and configure the amount of vCP-U and memory allocated to each.

Potential uses for read replicas include:

- **Increasing throughput**: Distribute read requests among multiple read replicas to achieve higher throughput for both read-write and read-only workloads.
- **Offloading read-only workloads**: Assign reporting or analytical workloads to a read replica to prevent impacting the performance of read-write application workloads.
- **Managing data access**: Provide read-only data access to certain users or applications that do not need write access.
- **Customizing resource usage**: Configure different CPU and memory resources for each read replica to cater to the specific needs of different users and applications.
