### Postgres version updates

Supported Postgres versions were updated to [14.11](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.11/), [15.6](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.6/), and [16.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.2/), respectively.

### Change the email associated with your account

We've added the ability to change the email associated with your account. For example, if you previously signed up using a work-based social account and now want to use your personal email, you can make this change under **Profile → Account Settings → Personal Information** or using this direct link: [change email](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/profile?modal=change_email).

See [Changing your email](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up#changing-your-email) for details.

### Neon serverless driver connection caching

Connection caching is now enabled by default at the Neon proxy for HTTP fetch queries using the [Neon serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver). Connection caching provides server-side connection pooling so that a new connection does not have to be created for each query. Previously, this feature could only be enabled by setting an experimental `fetchConnectionCache` option to `true` in your serverless driver connection configuration. If you currently specify this option, you can now remove it. The server-side connection cache works with both pooled and unpooled connections.

### Fixes & improvements

- Fixed an issue that caused asterisk values masking passwords in `DATABASE_URL` values to be incorrectly displayed in the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon).
- Production environment variables set by the Neon Vercel Integration are now updated if you change your Neon project's primary branch.
- Corrected the default Postgres in the **Create project** modal and Neon API.
- Fixed an issue that caused an error page to be displayed when selecting **Settings** and then **Storage** in the Neon Console.
- Fixed an issue that prevented users from logging in to the Neon Console. 
- The [Get projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) API now includes a `search` parameter that lets you search for projects by project name or id.
- Neon now removes _unused_ logical replication slots after a period of time to avoid unnecessary retention of write-ahead logs, which prevents removing data snapshots that are no longer required.
- The [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role now has membership in the predefined `pg_monitor` Postgres role, which provides read/execute privileges on various Postgres monitoring views and functions. For example, a `neon_superuser` role can now:
    - View previously unavailable columns in the `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` view.
    - View queries executed by other users in the `pg_stat_statements` view.

    The `neon_superuser` can also grant the `pg_monitor` role to other Postgres roles.
