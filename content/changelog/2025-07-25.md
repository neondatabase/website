## Bring your own email provider to Neon Auth

Neon Auth now supports sending emails for user invites, password resets, and notifications.

Use our shared email server for development, then switch to your own provider when you're ready. Read more in the [docs](/docs/neon-auth/email-configuration).

## Neon AI Assistant now available for Free plan users

We've expanded access to our Neon AI Assistant! Previously available for Launch and Scale plan users, the AI Assistant is now available for **all users, including Free plan**. Find it under **?** > **Get help** in the Console. Our AI assistant can help:

- Answer questions about Neon features, workflows, and troubleshooting.
- Find relevant documentation and best practices.

## Devin AI integrates with Neon through MCP Marketplace

You can now use **Devin**, Cognition Lab's AI software engineer, with Neon's [MCP server](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/mcp-server-neon) through Cognition Lab's new MCP (Model Context Protocol) [marketplace](https://app.devin.ai/settings/mcp-marketplace)! This helps Devin manage your Neon databases using natural language commands for tasks like creating projects, running SQL queries, and performing database migrations.

This integration demonstrates how Neon's MCP server, designed as a workflow-first API for LLMs, enables AI agents to safely and confidently tackle complex database challenges.

[Read the full blog post](https://neon.com/blog/devin-and-neon-mcp-marketplace) to learn more, or read our [MCP server docs](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server) to see how it works.

## Updated connection strings from Neon CLI and Neon API

Recently, we added the `channel_binding=require` option to connection strings and snippets in the Neon console, improving connection security. You can read more about this update in our [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/postgres-needs-better-connection-security-defaults).

Now, we've also updated the connection strings returned by the Neon CLI and Neon API to include the same security enhancement.

**CLI example**

```bash shouldWrap
neon cs --project-id purple-cake-43891234
```

**Will now return**

```bash shouldWrap
postgresql://neondb_owner:[password]@ep-shiny-sound-a5ydo1ie.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/testingneon?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

For upgrade instructions for the CLI, see [Upgrading the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install#upgrade).

## Export Neon metrics and Postgres logs to Grafana

You can now monitor your Neon databases with Grafana Cloud using our OpenTelemetry integration, which lets you forward metrics and Postgres logs from Neon to any OTEL-compatible observability platform.

Check out the [Grafana Cloud integration guide](https://neon.com/docs/guides/grafana-cloud) for setup instructions, a list of available metrics, and example dashboards.

OTEL support is available on Neon's Scale, Business, and Enterprise plans.

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **MCP server updates**
  - We've deprecated Server-Sent Events (SSE) and now recommend **streamable HTTP** as the preferred connection method. The [README](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/mcp-server-neon/blob/main/README.md) has been updated to reflect this change.

  - Introduced a **list_organizations** tool to list all organizations that the current user has access to. This tool allows optional filtering by organization name or ID.

- **Datadog and OpenTelemetry integrations**
  - We enhanced the integration cards (accessible from your project's **Integrations** page in the Neon Console) for [Datadog](/docs/guides/datadog) and [OpenTelemetry](/docs/guides/opentelemetry) to give you better visibility into your export activity:
    - **Export statistics** now show how many metrics and logs were exported in the last 5 minutes, using easy-to-read K/M formatting.
    - **Failure alerts** warn you of recent export issues with clear error and warning messages.

    These updates make it easier to monitor your integrations at a glance.

  - We also resolved an issue where entering an incorrect API key in the OpenTelemetry integration would incorrectly reset the authentication method, showing both API key and Bearer inputs. The form now correctly resets to the chosen method.
