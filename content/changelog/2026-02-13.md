title: Add org members by domain, Neon MCP Server updates, and the Compute Autoscaling Report
---

## Add organization members by domain

You can now add members to your organization by email domain. Organization admins can add and verify one or more domains (for example, `yourcompany.com`) in your Neon organization **Settings**, under **Domains**.

When a user signs up or logs in to Neon with an email that matches a verified domain, they’re automatically added to your Neon organization as a Member, no invite email required. They see your organization in the org switcher in the Neon Console.

This is useful for teams that want everyone within the company email domain to have access without needing to send individual invites. You simply add your domain in the Neon Console, add a TXT record at your DNS provider to verify ownership, then click **Verify** in the Neon Console.

Colleagues who already have Neon accounts are added to the organization the next time they log in. For the full flow and behavior (roles, multiple domains), see [Add members by domain](/docs/manage/orgs-add-members-by-domain).

## Neon MCP Server updates

This week’s Neon MCP Server release brings new tools for pulling Neon documentation and setup guidance into your development environment, plus a new guide for connecting [Google Jules](https://jules.google.com) to the Neon MCP Server.

**New documentation retrieval tools**

The MCP Server now includes two tools so your AI agent or MCP client can fetch Neon docs on demand:

- **`list_docs_resources`** – Lists all available Neon documentation pages from the docs index. Returns page URLs and titles so you can choose which page to load.
- **`get_doc_resource`** – Fetches a specific Neon documentation page as markdown. Use `list_docs_resources` first to discover page slugs, then pass the slug to this tool to load the content.

Together, these tools let your agent or assistant look up setup, configuration, and how-to content from the Neon docs without leaving the chat.

**Neon MCP Server on Google Jules**

The Neon MCP Server is now available in [Google Jules](https://jules.google.com), Google's AI-powered coding assistant. Create a Neon API key, add the server in Jules settings, and you're set. Full setup steps are in [Connect MCP clients to Neon](/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#jules).

## Compute Autoscaling Report

We've published a [Compute Autoscaling Report](https://neon.com/autoscaling-report) that breaks down how Neon's autoscaling compute compares to provisioned, fixed compute sizes, based on real production workloads that run on Neon.

<Admonition type="comingSoon" title="Key Findings">

- Production databases on Neon use 2.4x less compute and 50% less cost than if they were running on provisioned, fixed compute sizes.
- Putting the same production workloads on provisioned, fixed compute sizes would result in 55 performance degradations per database per month.
- Read replicas on Neon use 4x less compute than if they were running on provisioned, fixed compute sizes.
- Running the same small scale-to-zero workloads on provisioned, fixed compute sizes would cost 7.5x more.

</Admonition>

The report walks through what happens when you use provisioned, fixed compute sizes vs. autoscaling compute, and how that impacts cost and performance. If you've ever wondered how much autoscaling actually saves you (or how it behaves under real traffic), the report lays it out with real data and the full methodology.
