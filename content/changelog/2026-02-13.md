title: Auto-provision org members by domain, Neon MCP Server updates, and the Compute Autoscaling Report
---

## Auto-provision organization members by domain

You can now add members to your organization by email domain. Organization admins can add and verify one or more domains (for example, `yourcompany.com`) in **Settings** under **Domains**. When a user signs up or logs in to Neon with an email that matches a verified domain, they’re automatically added to the organization as a Member—no invite email needed. They simply see the org in their org switcher.

This is useful for teams that want everyone with a company email to have access without sending individual invites. You add the domain, add a TXT record at your DNS provider to verify ownership, then click **Verify** in the Console. Existing colleagues who already have Neon accounts are added the next time they log in. For the full flow and behavior (roles, seat limits, multiple domains), see [Auto-provision members by domain](/docs/manage/orgs-auto-provision-domain).

## Neon MCP Server updates

This week’s release focuses on the Neon MCP Server: new tools for pulling in documentation and updated setup guidance for another client.

**New documentation retrieval tools**

The MCP Server now includes two tools so your AI agent or MCP client can fetch Neon docs on demand:

- **`list_docs_resources`** – Lists all available Neon documentation pages from the docs index. Returns page URLs and titles so you can choose which page to load.
- **`get_doc_resource`** – Fetches a specific Neon documentation page as markdown. Use `list_docs_resources` first to discover page slugs, then pass the slug to this tool to load the content.

Together, these let your agent or assistant look up setup, configuration, and how-to content from the Neon docs without leaving the chat.

**Jules MCP client setup**

We’ve added step-by-step instructions for connecting [Google Jules](https://jules.google.com) to the Neon MCP Server. Create a Neon API key, add the server in Jules settings, and you’re ready to use natural language with your Neon databases. Full steps are in [Connect MCP clients to Neon](/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#jules).

For the full tool set and setup options, see [Neon MCP Server](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server).

## Compute Autoscaling Report

We've published a [Compute Autoscaling Report](https://neon.com/autoscaling-report) that breaks down how Neon's compute autoscaling compares to provisioned databases, based on real production workloads that run on Neon. It walks through what happens when you have to pick a fixed instance size up front versus when autoscaling dynamically adjusts compute size for you, and what that means for cost and performance. If you've ever wondered how much autoscaling actually saves (or how it behaves under real traffic), the report lays it out with real data and the full methodology.
