## Support for Azure Service Connector

If you're using Neon on Azure, you can now connect your applications using [Azure Service Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-connector/overview). It simplifies connectivity by handling credentials, networking, and configuration when linking Azure services—like App Service or Azure Functions—to your Neon Postgres database.

See our guide: [Connect Azure services to Neon with Azure Service Connector](/guides/azure-service-connector).

### Fixes & improvements

**Neon Console**

- Fixed an issue where the IP allow form wasn't updating correctly when switching between projects.
- Fixed a scaling issue with the database size chart on the **Monitoring** page. The chart now accurately reflects the full data range.
- Improved the display of email addresses in the "Created by" field of the branch list. Email addresses are now shown in lowercase, while names are capitalized as usual.
- Improved the reliability of the AI-generated query names in the SQL Editor by handling errors silently, preventing disruptions during use.
