### Support for pgvector 0.7.0

Neon now supports [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) version 0.7.0.

<YoutubeIframe embedId="pCcrDUBhUwA" />

This new version adds the following features and enhancements:

- New vector types: `halfvec` (up to 4,000 dimensions) and `sparsevec` (up to 1,000 non-zero elements)
- Support for indexing `bit` type (up to 64,000 dimensions) for binary vectors
- Support for quantizing vectors using the `binary_quantize` function
- New distance functions: `hamming_distance` and `jaccard_distance`
- HNSW indexing for L1 distance operations
- Support for CPU dispatching for distance functions on Linux x86-64

For the official list of updates, refer to the [pgvector changelog](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). For documentation related to these new capabilities, please see the [pgvector readme](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/).

For edge-case behavior differences noticed during our testing, please see [Differences in behavior between pgvector 0.5.1 and 0.7.0](/docs/extensions/pgvector#differences-in-behaviour-between-pgvector-051-and-070).

If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.

### Drizzle Studio in the Neon Console

We're excited to announce that the **Tables** page in the Neon Console, which lets you explore the tables and data in your Neon databases, is now powered by [Drizzle Studio](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview). This integration introduces several new capabilities to the **Tables** page, including the ability to add, update, and delete records, filter data, add or remove columns, drop or truncate tables, and export data in `.json` and `.csv` formats.

### Postgres version updates

The Postgres versions supported by Neon have been updated to [14.12](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.12/), [15.7](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.7/), and [16.3](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.3/), respectively.

### Fixes & improvements

- The Neon CLI [connection-string](/docs/reference/cli-connection-string) command and the Neon API [Get connection URI](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconnectionuri) method now generate a connection URI with a `postgresql://` scheme designator instead of the shorter `postgres://` designator. While both scheme designators are [valid](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS), we found the longer version to be more widely supported.
- Added validation for _Scale to zero_ minimum settings. For setting details, see [Scale to zero limits](/docs/guides/scale-to-zero-guide#scale-to-zero-limits).
- Added a **Charges to date** field to the **Billing summary** section of the **Billing** page.
- You can now access the **Edit compute endpoint** modal from the **Branches** widget on the **Dashboard** by clicking the compute endpoint link.
- Fixed an issue on the **Branches** page that prevented a new branch from being listed immediately after it was created.
- Fixed a styling issue that prevented the "Forgot password?" link from being fully visible on the Neon sign-in page while in dark mode.
