### Introducing the Neon CLI

Neon is pleased to announce the release of the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli), a command-line interface that enables developers to manage Neon resources directly from the terminal. The Neon CLI supports numerous operations, including creating and managing projects, branches, databases, roles, read replicas, and more, directly from your terminal. You can also use Neon CLI commands in developer workflows and pipelines.

You can install the Neon CLI with a single command:

```bash
npm i -g neonctl
```

Homebrew is also supported:

```bash
brew install neonctl
```

To get started with the Neon CLI, read the [blog post](/blog/cli) or refer to the [Neon CLI reference](/docs/reference/neon-cli).

### Graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search in Postgres

Neon is pleased to announce the release of our new `pg_embedding` extension, which enables using the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search in Postgres and [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/pgembedding).

The `pg_embedding` extension increases speed by up to 20x for 99% accuracy for approximate nearest neighbor search compared to `pgvector`.

Implementing `pg_embedding` in your application involves running a few simple SQL statements. Prior knowledge of vector indexes is optional. To learn more, read the [blog post](/blogension-for-vector-search), refer to the `pg_embedding` documentation, or checkout the [AI page](/docs/ai/ai-intro) on our website.

### Fixes & improvements

Proxy: The wake-up logic for compute nodes was updated to reduce the number of errors returned to clients attempting to connect to Neon. Wake-up logic now supports quicker retries and will skip a connection attempt if failure is expected. Additionally, a 100ms sleep interval and IO error handling were introduced to manage scenarios in which compute nodes are not yet available as they wait for a Kubernetes DNS to be propagated.
