Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

## Another feature

Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

## Third feature

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

## New NAT gateway IP addresses

We've added new NAT gateway IP addresses in three AWS regions to expand infrastructure capacity. If you have external IP allowlists that enable connections from external services into Neon, **update those allowlists soon to include the new addresses** to avoid connectivity issues.

See our [Regions documentation](/docs/introduction/regions#aws-nat-gateway-ip-addresses) for the complete list of NAT gateway IPs for all regions.

## New VPC endpoint services for Private Networking

We've added new VPC endpoint service addresses for Private Networking in the AWS US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon) regions. If you're setting up Private Networking in these regions, you can now use the additional endpoint service addresses for enhanced infrastructure capacity and reliability.

For the complete list of VPC endpoint service addresses by region, see our [Private Networking guide](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking).

## Postgres extension updates

We've expanded extension support for Postgres 18.

**Now available on Postgres 18:**

| Extension   | Version |
| :---------- | :------ |
| TimescaleDB | 2.24.0  |
| pgx_ulid    | 0.2.2   |

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

<details>
<summary>**SQL Editor**</summary>

- Added a copy button to the SQL Editor that lets you copy query results as JSON directly to your clipboard without downloading a file. The copy button appears alongside the download button in the query results view.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Neon API**</summary>

- Fixed an iss in the Neon consumption history API endpoint that caused errors when retrieving project consumption data.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Data anonymization**</summary>

- You can now anonymize columns that are part of primary keys when creating anonymized branches. Neon automatically handles foreign key constraints during the anonymization process, ensuring referential integrity is maintained across related tables.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**OpenTelemetry integration**</summary>

- OpenTelemetry monitoring integrations now support gRPC protocol endpoints in addition to HTTP/HTTPS. When configuring an OpenTelemetry integration, you can use gRPC OTLP endpoints, and Neon will validate your credentials before saving the configuration.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Postgres roles**</summary>

- Fixed an issue where deleting a database role would fail if the role had been granted specific privileges (such as SELECT or INSERT) by another non-superuser role. Role deletion now properly revokes all individual privileges before removing the role, ensuring successful deletion in all scenarios.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Neon CLI**</summary>

- Added project recovery commands to the Neon CLI. You can now list deleted projects within their recovery grace period using `neonctl projects list --recoverable-only` and recover them using `neonctl projects recover <project-id>`. This provides CLI access to the [project recovery feature](/docs/manage/projects#recover-a-deleted-project) that was previously only available through the Console and API.

- The `neon init` command now requires authentication before running. If you're not already authenticated, the CLI will automatically open your browser to log in. Additionally, `neon init` now installs Cursor skills from the [Neon skills repository](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/ai-skills) instead of rules, providing more flexible and powerful AI agent capabilities for database development workflows.

To access these new features, upgrade to the latest version of the Neon CLI (version 2.20.2). For upgrade instructions, see [Neon CLI upgrade](/docs/reference/cli-install#upgrade).

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Neon VS Code Extension**</summary>

- The Neon VS Code Extension now automatically focuses on the Databases view after connecting to a branch, making it easier to immediately see your database schema and objects. The extension also includes performance improvements with smart caching and background data refresh for faster load times. Upgrade to the latest version to access these improvements.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Neon MCP Server**</summary>

- The `provision_neon_auth` tool is now idempotent and returns your Neon Auth configuration details (base URL and JWKS URL) even when Neon Auth is already provisioned. This makes it easier to retrieve your authentication configuration without needing to make separate API calls.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Neon Skills**</summary>

- You can now install Neon agent skills as a Claude Code plugin, which bundles both the skills and the Neon MCP Server for natural language database management. Install using `/plugin marketplace add neondatabase/agent-skills` followed by `/plugin install using-neon@neon-agent-skills` in Claude Code. See [Neon Agent Skills](https://github.com/neondatabase/agent-skills).
