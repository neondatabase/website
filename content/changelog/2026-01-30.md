## New NAT gateway IP addresses

We've added new NAT gateway IP addresses in three AWS regions to expand infrastructure capacity. If you have external IP allowlists that enable connections from external services into Neon, **update those allowlists soon to include the new addresses** to avoid connectivity issues.

See our [Regions documentation](/docs/introduction/regions#aws-nat-gateway-ip-addresses) for the complete list of NAT gateway IPs for all regions.

## New VPC endpoint services for Private Networking

We've added new VPC endpoint service addresses for Private Networking in the AWS US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon) regions. If you're setting up Private Networking in these regions, you can now use the additional endpoint service addresses for enhanced infrastructure capacity and reliability.

For the complete list of VPC endpoint service addresses by region, see our [Private Networking guide](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking).
