## Neon Auth is here! Get authentication in a couple of clicks

After a successful Early Access period, Neon Auth is now available in **Beta** to all users! Set up authentication for your application without writing integration code — Neon Auth automatically syncs user profiles from your auth provider straight to your Neon database.

![Neon Auth Quick Start setup screen](/docs/changelog/neon_auth_quickstart.png)

What you get:

- Query **user profiles directly from your database** using the `neon_auth.users_sync` table
- Use our **complete API** to create integrations automatically, add users, and transfer ownership
- Get up and running with a **pre-configured Stack Auth project** that Neon manages, with the option to transfer it to your Stack Auth account later

Get started:

- Set up your auth integration in the Neon Console with our Quick Start or connect your existing Stack Auth project
- Explore our [sample Todo app](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon-auth-demo-app) showing Neon Auth with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- Check out the [documentation](/docs/guides/neon-auth) for full details

_Currently supporting [Stack Auth](https://stack-auth.com/), with more providers planned._

## Private Networking is generally available

Neon's **Private Networking** feature, which enables secure database connections via AWS PrivateLink, is now generally available and self-serve. This feature keeps traffic between your client application and Neon database within AWS's private network, bypassing the public internet.

This feature is available on our Business and Enterprise plans, but if you're on our Launch or Scale plan and want to try it out, you can request a trial from your Neon organization **Settings** page.

The GA release includes Neon API and CLI support for self-serve setup and management of Private Networking. See our [Neon Private Networking](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) guide for details.

## Database Branching for Vercel Preview Environments

For users who come to Neon through Vercel — the **Neon Postgres Native Integration**, available from the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace), now supports **database branching for preview environments**. You can now configure your integration to automatically create a dedicated database branch for each Vercel preview deployment. This lets you preview your application and database changes together without touching your production database or setting up a separate development database. To get started, see [Vercel Native Integration Previews](/docs/guides/vercel-native-integration-previews).

## Active Queries and Query History views open to all

The **Active Queries** and **Query History** views in the Neon Console are now out of Early Access and available to all users. You can find them on the **Monitoring** page in your Neon project.

![Neon query history](/docs/changelog/query_history_relnotes.png)

- The **Active Queries** view displays up to 100 currently running queries for the selected **Branch**, **Compute**, and **Database**.
- The **Query History** view shows the top 100 previously run queries for the selected **Branch**, **Compute**, and **Database**. Queries can be sorted by **Frequency** or **Average time**.

For more about these views, see [Monitor active queries](/docs/introduction/monitor-active-queries) and [Monitor query history](/docs/introduction/monitor-query-history).

## Scheduled updates for Launch, Scale, and Business plans

A few weeks ago, we announced _scheduled updates_ for Neon, which include Postgres version upgrades, security patches, and Neon feature enhancements.

Updates, which take only a few seconds, are applied at the scheduled time or the next time your compute restarts.

Updates for Launch and Scale Plan users will start rolling out next week. You can check for updates notices and choose a preferred update window — [learn how](/docs/manage/updates#updates-on-paid-plans).

![Paid plan updates UI](/docs/manage/paid_plan_updates.png)

**Business plan users** can expect **update notices** to start appearing next week on the **Updates** page shown above. We aim to provide 7 days' notice for updates on paid plans. Please select a preferred update window — [learn how](/docs/manage/updates#updates-on-paid-plans).

We also support checking for update notices and setting update windows programmatically using the [Neon API](/docs/manage/updates#check-for-updates-using-the-neon-api).

For more information about updates, see our [Updates documentation](/docs/manage/updates). If you have questions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or [contact Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

## Manage your database from Cursor or Claude Desktop

You can now manage your Neon database directly from Cursor or Claude Desktop using natural language, made possible by the [Neon Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).

- [Getting started with Neon Postgres MCP server with Claude Desktop](/guides/neon-mcp-server)

## Chat with Neon AI while you code

In case you missed it, Neon now offers Copilot Chat extensions for GitHub and VS Code.

![GitHub Copilot extensions](/docs/changelog/copilot_extension.png)

**Install them now:**

- [GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/neon-database)
- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=buildwithlayer.neon-integration-expert-15j6N).

Currently, the extensions support chatting with the Neon documentation. Support for operations like creating branches, creating databases, and running migrations is coming soon.
