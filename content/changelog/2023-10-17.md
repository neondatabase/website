### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Added new fields for configuring the scale to zero delay period for Neon compute instances, allowing you to specify the delay period in seconds, minutes, hours, or days.

  ![Scale to zero delay controls](/docs/relnotes/autosuspend_controls.png)

  Neon's _Scale to zero_ feature automatically suspends a compute endpoint after a period of inactivity to minimize compute costs. This feature is also known as "scale-to-zero". By default, suspension occurs after 5 minutes of inactivity. [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can configure the scale to zero setting when creating a project, changing default compute settings, creating a compute endpoint, or editing a compute endpoint.

  For more information about this feature, see [Scale to zero](/docs/introduction/scale-to-zero).

- UI: When sharing a Neon project with someone who does not have a Neon account, an email invitation is now sent to the specified email address. Previously, an email was only sent to registered Neon users.

  Project sharing is a [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature that allows you to share your project with other Neon accounts. For more information, see [Project sharing](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide).

- UI: Updated PostgreSQL 14 and 15 keyword highlighting in the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), and addressed other syntax highlighting and autocompletion issues.
