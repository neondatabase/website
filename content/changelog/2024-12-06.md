### Neon is Now Available as an Azure Native Integration

If your company uses Azure, getting started with Neon is now easier than ever. This week, we launched [Neon as an Azure Native Integration](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/neon1722366567200.neon_serverless_postgres_azure_prod?tab=Overview), enabling developers to deploy Neon Postgres databases directly from the Azure portal.

With this new integration, you can:

- Provision and manage Neon organizations directly within Azure, using the Azure portal, CLI, or SDK.
- Access Neon with your Microsoft credentials for simplified security and compliance.
- Include Neon charges in your Azure bill.

For moe, [read the announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/neon-is-now-available-as-an-azure-native-integration).

### New Azure regions

We’ve added support for two new Azure regions:

- **Azure Germany West Central** (Frankfurt) &mdash; `azure-gwc`
- **Azure West US 3** (Arizona) &mdash; `azure-westus3`

For a full list of regions supported by Neon, see [Regions](/docs/introduction/regions).

### Support for database schema management in the Neon Console

![Drizzle Studio Schema Management UI](/docs/relnotes/drizzle_schema_mgmt.png)

The **Tables** page in the Neon Console, powered by Drizzle Studio, received a major update this week. In addition to managing your data, you can now manage your database schema directly from the **Tables** page. New schema management options include:

- Creating, altering, and dropping schemas
- Creating and altering tables
- Creating and altering views
- Creating enums
- Refreshing the database schema

We’d love to hear your thoughts on these new capabilities! Share your feedback through the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or join the conversation on [Discord](https://t.co/kORvEuCUpJ).

Stay updated on Drizzle Studio improvements and fixes by following the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

### A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Neon Postgres database

We’ve released an open-source [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server for Neon, enabling any MCP Client such as Claude Desktop to interact with Neon’s API using natural language. AI agents can use our MCP server to perform actions such as creating databases, running SQL queries, and managing database migrations. For more, [read the announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/let-claude-manage-your-neon-databases-our-mcp-server-is-here) and try it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).

### Archive storage on paid plans

A few weeks ago, we announced [branch archiving on the Free Plan](/docs/changelog/2024-11-15#branch-archiving-on-the-free-plan), which automatically stores inactive branches in cost-efficient archive storage. This feature is now available on our paid plans: Launch, Scale, and Business. Here’s what this means for you:

- **More storage and reduced storage costs**: Branches **older than 14 days** and **not accessed for 24 hours** are automatically archived in cost-efficient archive storage.  
- **New archive storage allowances by plan**:  
  - Launch: 50 GB  
  - Scale: 250 GB  
  - Business: 2500 GB  
- **Billing for extra archive storage**: Extra storage beyond your plan’s allowance is billed at $0.10 per GB-month. Inactive branches meeting the thresholds above will now cost less.
- **Monitoring archive storage usage**: A new archive storage metric is available on the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
- **Archived branch details and identification**: Archived branches are marked with an archive icon in the console. The **Branches** page shows additional details, including the date and time a branch was archived.
- **Automatic archiving and unarchiving**: No action is needed to archive or unarchive branches. Unarchiving happens automatically when you access a branch.
- **Performance considerations**: You should notice little to no performance difference when connecting to or querying an archived branch, except for branches with large amounts of data where initial acecss may take a little longer until the branch is fully unarchived.

For more details, see [Branch archiving](/docs/guides/branch-archiving) and [Archive storage](/docs/introduction/architecture-overview#archive-storage).

### Simpler and cheaper "extra storage"

To simplify billing and reduce costs for extra storage beyond your plan's monthly allowance, we’ve switched to billing by GB-month. Previously, if you exceeded your storage allowance, you were allocated (and billed for) an extra storage unit at a prorated price for the rest of the month, even if the overage was brief. Now, you’re billed only for the storage you use. 

This change lowers extra storage costs and ensures Neon users are not charged for unused storage.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Console updates**

  - The **Monitoring** page graphs now display data in the local timezone instead of UTC. 
  - We added sorting for columns in the branches table on the **Branches** page. In addition, default and protected branches are always listed first, and the table now supports full keyboard navigation, allowing users to tab through table cells and rows.

- **Neon Authorize**

  [Neon Authorize](/docs/guides/neon-authorize) now supports verifying an `aud` (audience) claim in JWTs to limit access to specific applications or services. For providers like Firebase Auth and GCP Cloud Identity, which use the same JWKS URL across all projects, defining an intended audience is required.

  Configure the audience via the Neon Authorize UI or the [Neon Authorize API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/addprojectjwks). This enhancement adds support for **Firebase Auth** and **GCP Cloud Identity**. See [Supported providers](/docs/guides/neon-authorize#supported-providers) for the full list.

- **Neon API updates**

  - Removed the deprecated `primary_branch_only` property from the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Update project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) endpoints.
  - Deprecated the `branch_id` field in the [Update compute endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectendpoint); it will be removed in a future release.
  - Added an `archived` property to the branch object in the [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) endpoint, allowing branches to be created directly in [archive storage](/docs/introduction/architecture-overview#archive-storage).

- **Vercel Native Integration**

  History retention and logical replication settings are now configurable in Neon projects created in Vercel-created organizations. Previously, these settings could not be modified in Neon or Vercel.

- **Vercel Previews Integration**

  - Enhanced the Vercel Previews Integration drawer to make it easier to connect Neon projects to Vercel projects.
  - Updated the Vercel Previews Integration drawer to display connected Vercel projects in a more compact table view when more than three projects are connected.

- **Fixes**

  - Resolved an issue that blocked Schema Diff operations when other project operations were in progress. Schema Diff operations are now serialized to prevent concurrency errors.
  - Improved the error message in the Neon SQL Editor’s text-to-SQL AI feature when it fails to fetch the database schema.
  - Fixed inconsistencies in usage metrics and project allowances displayed on the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
  - Fixed an issue that allowed selecting a future date when setting a custom period on the **Monitoring** page.
