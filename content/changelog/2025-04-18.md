title: New default project setup, Neon MCP Server with Zed, and more
---

## New default project setup

New Neon projects now start with a better out-of-the-box setup to support your dev workflow.

Instead of a single `main` branch, you'll now get:

- A `production` branch (the default), designed for your production workload. It’s configured with a larger compute size (1–4 CU).
- A `development` branch, created as a child of production, intended for local development. It uses a smaller compute size (0.25–1 CU).

This new project default aligns with typical usage scenarios, where your production branch will need more compute power than your less active development branches—but if you need something different, you can [change your branch setup](/docs/manage/branches) or [compute sizes](/docs/manage/computes#edit-a-compute) at any time.

To learn more about integrating branching into your dev workflow, read our [Database branching workflow primer](/docs/get-started/workflow-primer).

## Neon MCP Server on Zed

You can now use the Neon MCP Server on [Zed](https://zed.dev/), a next-generation AI-powered code editor. For setup instructions, see [Get started with Zed and Neon Postgres MCP Server](/guides/zed-mcp-neon).

MCP support in Zed is currently in **preview**. You can download the **preview** version of Zed from [zed.dev/releases/preview](https://zed.dev/releases/preview).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon MCP Server**
  - The Neon MCP Server previously defaulted to the `neondb_owner` role when no Postgres role is provided, resulting in database access failures. It now uses the owner of the selected database instead. If a non-existent role is specified, the tool fails as expected.

    If no database name is provided, the server first looks for the Neon-created `neondb` database; if not found, it falls back to the first available database.

- **Neon Console**
  - Updated plan descriptions on the **Billing** page to include [root branch](/docs/reference/glossary#root-branch) limits for each plan.
  - Added support for enabling HIPAA for existing Neon projects. Previously, HIPAA support could only be enabled for newly created Neon projects. Neon offers HIPAA compliance as part of our Business and Enterprise plans. For details, see [HIPAA Compliance](/docs/security/hipaa).
  - Added a warning to the **Edit compute** drawer in the Neon Console to inform users that changing compute size settings may briefly interrupt database connections.
  - The default AWS region for new projects created in the Neon Console is now `AWS US East 1 (N. Virginia)`, instead of `AWS US East 2 (Ohio)`.

- **Neon API**
  - Added a new [Create auth user](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createneonauthnewuser) API that lets users of [Neon Auth](/docs/guides/neon-auth) add new users to the `neon_auth.users_sync` table. Newly created users are automatically propagated to your auth project, whether Neon-managed or provider-owned.
  - Changed the default AWS region for new Neon projects created via the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) API. If no `region_id` is specified, the default is now `aws-us-east-1` (N. Virginia), instead of `aws-us-east-2` (Ohio).
  - The `logical_size_bytes` quota in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Update project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) APIs sets a storage limit for each branch. Previously, exceeding this limit prevented the branch's compute from starting. Now, computes can still start even when the quota is exceeded—only write operations are blocked. This allows users to delete data and bring usage back under the limit.

    The change applies automatically when setting a new `logical_size_bytes` value via the `Update project` API, or on the next compute restart for projects with a pre-existing quota.

- **Fixes**
  - Fixed an issue in the Neon Console where branches created by a deleted user account couldn't be accessed. Attempting to open the branch returned a "Request failed" error.
  - Resolved an issue on the Project Dashboard where RAM usage was incorrectly shown in GiB instead of GB.
  - Resolved an issue in the [Neon Postgres Previews Integration](/docs/guides/vercel-previews-integration) on Vercel where branches with child branches were incorrectly marked as obsolete. The [automatic branch detection](/docs/guides/vercel-previews-integration#automatic-deletion) logic now checks for child branches.
  - Fixed an issue in the [Native Vercel integration](/docs/guides/vercel-native-integration) where the wrong password was set in Vercel preview environment variables if the default branch was defined as a protected branch.
