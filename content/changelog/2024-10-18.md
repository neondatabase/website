### New monitoring graphs

We're continuing to improve visibility into your database performance with two new graphs on the **Monitoring** page: [LFC hit rate](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#local-file-cache-hit-rate) and [Working set size](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#working-set-size).

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: 1, paddingRight: '20px' }}>

  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>

  </div>

The **Local file cache hit rate** graph shows the percentage of read requests served from memory. A high hit rate indicates better performance, as more data is served from cache (faster) instead of being pulled from storage (slower). See [What is the Local File Cache](/docs/extensions/neon#what-is-the-local-file-cache) for more info.

The **Working set size** graph tracks the amount of data your database accesses over time. For best performance, your working set should fit within the LFC, minimizing slower queries that pull data from storage. See [Working set size](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#working-set-size) for details.

### New banner for custom date range selection

Along with the new graphs on the **Monitoring** page, we also now added a banner to show your custom date range selection, making it a bit easier to keep track of your selected time frame when analyzing performance metrics.

### Support for removing backup branches created by restore operations

When working with branches, we recommend removing old and unused branches where possible. This helps free up disk space and keep your project organized. We’ve made that easier: you can now remove the backup branches created by restore operations on your project’s root branch (typically named `main`). Previously, the backup branches could not be removed.

For more details, and other recommendations, see [Deleting backup branches](/docs/guides/branch-restore#deleting-backup-branches).
