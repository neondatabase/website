title: Name your computes, TanStack integration, Neon Auth enhancements, and more
---

## Give your computes a custom name

You can now assign custom names to your branch’s computes. In the Neon Console, go to the **Branches** page, select a branch, and open the **Compute** tab. Click the edit icon next to a compute to rename it.

You can also set a name when _adding_ a new compute.

This enhancement is supported for both primary (read-write) and [read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) computes.

## TanStack integration & new open-source tools for JavaScript developers

We're excited to announce that Neon is now the official database partner of **TanStack**, and that we’ve released new open-source tools to simplify Postgres integration across the TanStack and Vite ecosystems:

- **Create TanStack Add-on**  
  Instantly set up a fullstack application with a Neon Postgres database with one simple command:
  `pnpm create tanstack --add-on neon`

- **Instagres (formerly Neon Launchpad)**  
  Instantly spin up a Postgres database with Instagres — no signup required. Perfect for workshops and rapid prototyping. Try it at [neon.new](https://neon.new/). To learn more, see our [Instagres docs](https://neon.com/docs/reference/instagres).

- **NeonDB (CLI + SDK)**  
  Bootstrap Neon Postgres database with the `neondb` CLI:  
  `npx neondb --yes`  
  Or integrate programmatically via `instantNeon()`.

- **Vite Plugin for Neon**  
  Use Instagres to spin up a Postgres database with any Vite app:  
  `npm add -D @neondatabase/vite-plugin-postgres`

These open-source tools are designed to streamline fullstack development with TanStack, Vite, and Postgres. Learn more:

## OAuth provider management for Neon Auth

You can now manage your project's OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft) directly in the **Neon Auth** config tab—enable or disable providers, and choose between using shared Neon Auth credentials or setting up your own custom client credentials.

New API endpoints also let you manage providers programmatically:

- [Add an OAuth provider](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/addneonauthoauthprovider)
- [List OAuth providers](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listneonauthoauthproviders)
- [Update an OAuth provider](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateneonauthoauthprovider)
- [Delete an OAuth provider](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteneonauthoauthprovider)

To learn more, see the [Neon Auth](/docs/neon-auth/overview) documentation.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon CLI**
  - The Neon CLI now supports a `--name` option that you can use when adding a compute or a read replica to a Neon branch.

    ```bash
    neon branches add-compute mybranch --name myreplica --type read_only
    ```

  - The CLI now automatically detects invalid credentials (401 responses), deletes them, and prompts for re-authentication instead of failing immediately

    > 🚀 If you're not using the Neon CLI yet, get set up in just a few steps with the [Neon CLI Quickstart](/docs/reference/cli-quickstart).

- **Fixes**
  - Addressed an issue where projects created via [Netlify DB](https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-db-database-for-ai-native-development/) and claimed into Vercel-managed org accounts could lose certain project configuration settings. To avoid this issue, transfers of projects created via Netlify DB to Vercel-managed org accounts are currently not supported.
