## Postgres version updates

We updated supported Postgres versions to [14.21](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.21/), [15.16](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.16/), [16.12](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.12/), [17.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.8/), and [18.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/18.2/), respectively.

```sql
SELECT version();
PostgreSQL 18.2 (e21737f) on aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04.1) 13.3.0, 64-bit
```

When a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts. For more about how we handle Postgres version upgrades, refer to our [Postgres version support policy](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).

## TimescaleDB on Postgres 18

We've added support for the [timescaledb](/docs/extensions/timescaledb) extension on Postgres 18. Install it with:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;
```

See [The timescaledb extension](/docs/extensions/timescaledb) for setup and usage.

## New Neon Agent Skill: Claimable Postgres (pg.new)

We've added **claimable-postgres** to the [Neon Agent Skills](https://github.com/neondatabase/agent-skills) collection. With this skill, your AI assistant can provide an instant temporary database via [Claimable Postgres by Neon](https://pg.new/) and obtain a connection string autonomously, without human intervention, account creation, or credit card. For details, see [Claimable Postgres by Neon](/docs/reference/claimable-postgres).

## Git worktrees with Neon branching

Run multiple AI coding agents in parallel without collisions by giving each agent its own Git worktree (isolated working directory) and Neon database branch from a single repository. The guide shows how to avoid file, Git, and database conflicts and ties it together with a post-checkout hook so spinning up a new agent with its own database takes one command. See the guide: [Git worktrees with Neon branching](https://neon.com/guides/git-worktrees-neon-branching).

## Google Jules and Neon MCP

Use the Neon MCP Server with [Google Jules](https://jules.google.com/) to give AI agents an isolated database branch for each feature. Connect Jules to Neon MCP so it can spin up branches, apply schema changes and migrations, and open PRs without touching production. See the guide: [Google Jules and Neon MCP](https://neon.com/guides/google-jules-neon-mcp).

## Fixes and improvements

<details>
<summary>**Snapshots**</summary>

On paid plans, the snapshot limit (10) now applies only to manual snapshots. Scheduled backup snapshots no longer count toward that limit, so scheduled backups will no longer fail when you've already created your maximum number of manual snapshots.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Neon Console**</summary>

The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.3.2. This release fixes a regression where **Add Column** → **Review and Commit** could produce a zod validation error. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Data anonymization**</summary>

Anonymized branches are now supported on projects with [IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow) or [Private Networking](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) enabled. You can now create and use anonymized branches for these projects without restriction. For more information, see [Data anonymization](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization).

</details>

<details>
<summary>**PgBouncer**</summary>

The PgBouncer version used by Neon to offer [connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling) support was updated to [version 1.25.1](https://www.pgbouncer.org/changelog.html#pgbouncer-125x) for the latest updates and patches.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Neon Auth**</summary>

We fixed an issue where deleting a database with Neon Auth left stale state and caused 500 errors when opening Neon Auth settings (e.g., OAuth or SMTP).
