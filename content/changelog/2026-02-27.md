title: Neon Auth Organizations, Data API Advisors, TimescaleDB on PG 18, and more
---

## Neon Auth updates and enhancements

You can now configure **Organizations** for Neon Auth from the Neon Console. In your project, open **Auth** in the sidebar and go to the **Configuration** tab to find the new Organizations section. You can enable or disable organizations, set a maximum number of organizations per user, allow or disallow users to create organizations, and choose the default role for organization creators (admin or owner). These settings support multi-tenant apps where users create and join organizations.

Additionally, we've updated Neon Auth to use Better Auth 1.4.18. We also fixed an issue where deleting a database with Neon Auth left stale state and caused 500 errors when opening Neon Auth settings (e.g., OAuth or SMTP).

## Data API Advisors

**Data API Advisors** provide recommendations to improve your database, such as adding indexes or updating statistics. Use the advisors to get actionable suggestions and keep your database performing well. For details, see [Data API Advisors](/docs/data-api/database-advisor).

## TimescaleDB on Postgres 18

We've added support for the [timescaledb](/docs/extensions/timescaledb) extension on Postgres 18. You can now use TimescaleDB for time-series data on projects running Postgres 18. Install it with `CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;` and see [The timescaledb extension](/docs/extensions/timescaledb) for setup and usage.

## New Agent Skill: Claimable Postgres (pg.new)

We've added a new skill to the [Neon Agent Skills](https://github.com/neondatabase/agent-skills) collection: **claimable-postgres**. When your AI assistant has this skill, it can help you get an instant temporary Postgres database via [Claimable Postgres by Neon](https://pg.new/) (no signup or credit card), ideal for "give me a database now," prototyping, or quick tests. The skill guides the agent to use the CLI (`npx get-db`), SDK, or REST API and reminds users about the 72-hour expiry and claim URL.

<Admonition type="tip" title="How to get Neon Agent Skills">

**Quick setup (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code):**

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init
```

**Or install skills only:**

```bash
npx skills add neondatabase/agent-skills
```

**Editor-specific:** In **Claude Code**, run `/plugin marketplace add neondatabase/agent-skills` then `/plugin install neon-postgres@neon`. In **Cursor** chat, run `/add-plugin neon-postgres`.

## New guides: Neon with Jules and Git worktrees

We've added two new guides you might like:

- **[Git worktrees with Neon branching](/docs/guides/git-worktrees-neon-branching)** — Use [Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) with Neon branching to work on multiple branches from a single clone, each with its own working directory and a linked Neon branch.
- **[Google Jules and Neon MCP](/guides/google-jules-neon-mcp)** — Connect [Google Jules](https://jules.google.com/) to the Neon MCP Server to manage Neon projects, branches, and databases from Jules using natural language.

## Postgres version updates

We updated supported Postgres versions to [14.21](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.21/), [15.16](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.16/), [16.12](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.12/), [17.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.8/), and [18.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/18.2/), respectively.

When a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts. For more about how we handle Postgres version upgrades, refer to our [Postgres version support policy](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).

<details>
<summary>**Neon API**</summary>

On paid plans, the snapshot limit (10) now applies only to manual snapshots. Scheduled backup snapshots no longer count toward that limit, so scheduled backups will no longer fail when you've already created your maximum number of manual snapshots. On the Free plan you get one manual snapshot; only manual snapshots count toward the limit.

<details>
<summary>**Neon Console**</summary>

The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.3.2. This release fixes a regression where **Add Column** → **Review and Commit** could produce a zod validation error. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

<summary>**Data anonymization**</summary>

Anonymized branches are now supported on projects with [IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow) or [Private Networking](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) enabled. You can now create and use anonymized branches for these projects without restriction.

<details>
<summary>**PgBouncer**</summary>

- The PgBouncer version used by Neon to offer pooled connection support was updated to [version 1.25.1](https://www.pgbouncer.org/changelog.html#pgbouncer-125x) for the latest updates and patches.
