## Postgres version updates

We updated supported Postgres versions to [14.21](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.21/), [15.16](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.16/), [16.12](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.12/), [17.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.8/), and [18.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/18.2/), respectively.

```sql
SELECT version();
PostgreSQL 18.2 (e21737f) on aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04.1) 13.3.0, 64-bit
```

When a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts. For more about how we handle Postgres version upgrades, refer to our [Postgres version support policy](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).

## TimescaleDB on Postgres 18

We've added support for the [timescaledb](/docs/extensions/timescaledb) extension on Postgres 18. Install it with:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;
```

See [The timescaledb extension](/docs/extensions/timescaledb) for setup and usage.

## New Neon Agent Skill: Claimable Postgres (pg.new)

We've added a new skill to the [Neon Agent Skills](https://github.com/neondatabase/agent-skills) collection: **claimable-postgres**. When your AI assistant has this skill, it can help users get an instant temporary database via [Claimable Postgres by Neon](https://pg.new/) (no signup or credit card). The skill is ideal for platforms and services that want to offer Postgres to their users without requiring signup or registration, such as framework plugins, CLIs, or platforms. For details, see [Claimable Postgres by Neon](/docs/reference/claimable-postgres).

## Git worktrees with Neon branching

Use [Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) with Neon branching to work on multiple branches from a single clone, each with its own working directory and a linked Neon branch. See the guide: [Git worktrees with Neon branching](/docs/guides/git-worktrees-neon-branching).

## Google Jules and Neon MCP

Connect [Google Jules](https://jules.google.com/) to the Neon MCP Server to manage Neon projects, branches, and databases from Jules using natural language. See the guide: [Google Jules and Neon MCP](/guides/google-jules-neon-mcp).

## Fixes and improvements

<details>
<summary>**Snapshots**</summary>

On paid plans, the snapshot limit (10) now applies only to manual snapshots. Scheduled backup snapshots no longer count toward that limit, so scheduled backups will no longer fail when you've already created your maximum number of manual snapshots.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Neon Console**</summary>

The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.3.2. This release fixes a regression where **Add Column** → **Review and Commit** could produce a zod validation error. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Data anonymization**</summary>

Anonymized branches are now supported on projects with [IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow) or [Private Networking](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) enabled. You can now create and use anonymized branches for these projects without restriction. For more information, see [Data anonymization](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization).

</details>

<details>
<summary>**PgBouncer**</summary>

The PgBouncer version used by Neon to offer [connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling) support was updated to [version 1.25.1](https://www.pgbouncer.org/changelog.html#pgbouncer-125x) for the latest updates and patches.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Neon Auth**</summary>

We fixed an issue where deleting a database with Neon Auth left stale state and caused 500 errors when opening Neon Auth settings (e.g., OAuth or SMTP).
