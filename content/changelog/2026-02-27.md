## Neon Auth updates and enhancements

You can now configure **Organizations** for Neon Auth from the Neon Console. In your project, open **Auth** in the sidebar and go to the **Configuration** tab to find the new Organizations section. You can enable or disable organizations, set a maximum number of organizations per user, allow or disallow users to create organizations, and choose the default role for organization creators (admin or owner). These settings support multi-tenant apps where users create and join organizations.

## Git worktrees with Neon branching

A new guide explains how to use [Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) with Neon branching so you can work on multiple branches from a single clone, each with its own working directory and a linked Neon branch. See [Git worktrees with Neon branching](/docs/guides/git-worktrees-neon-branching).

## Data API Advisors

**Data API Advisors** provide recommendations to improve your database, such as adding indexes or updating statistics. Use the advisors to get actionable suggestions and keep your database performing well. For details, see [Data API Advisors](/docs/data-api/database-advisor).

## Timescale DB on Postgres 18

We've added support for the [timescaledb](/docs/extensions/timescaledb) extension on Postgres 18. You can now use Timescale DB for time-series data on projects running Postgres 18. Install it with `CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;` and see [The timescaledb extension](/docs/extensions/timescaledb) for setup and usage.
