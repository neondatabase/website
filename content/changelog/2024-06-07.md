### Create a Postgres database in seconds at pg.new

First, there was **docs.new** for instantly creating Google Docs. Then, **repo.new** made adding new GitHub repositories a breeze. Now, meet [pg.new](https://pg.new) &#8212; your gateway to spinning up new Postgres databases in seconds. Simply visit [pg.new](https://pg.new) and you'll be taken straight to the **Create project** page in the Neon Console, where you can set up your new Neon Postgres project.

### Fixes & improvements

- Added your current timezone to the **Restore branch** confirmation page, to make it a little easier to understand the timestamp you are restoring to.
- Scale plan users can now view database metrics for the past 14 days on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console. To try it out, go to the **Monitoring** page and select the **Last 14 days** item from the **Other** menu. Previously, metrics could only be viewed for the past 7 days.
- The **Database size** chart on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console now displays size information for up to 10 databases.
- Adjusted the functioning of the **Create support ticket** modal in the Neon Console to avoid automatically selecting **Branch** and **Compute** field values when opening the modal.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the **Autosuspend delay** option from being displayed on the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer in shared projects.
- After the next time you log in to Neon Console, navigating to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) will automatically route you to [console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech).
