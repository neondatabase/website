### Updates to the Neon CLI

We've added some terrific new features to our CLI:

- **Configurable compute sizing with `-cu` option, including support for autoscaling**

  You can now set your compute size when creating a branch using the CLI. For a fixed compute size, use a single number (e.g., `--cu 2`). For autoscaling, specify a range with a dash (e.g., `--cu 0.5-3`).

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  neon branches add-compute main --cu 0.5-3
  ```

  Previously, compute size was determined by your default settings in the console. For more about branching via the CLI, see [Neon CLI commands — branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches).

- **Bootstrap new applications with Neon using the `create-app` command**

  You can now scaffold applications using the CLI with the `create-app` command. Choose your package manager, framework, ORM, and authentication method, and go. Read the [docs](/docs/reference/cli-create-app) for details. This exciting new feature is just getting started. More to come!

### Added polish to our Branches page

Branching is still a relatively new concept in the database world, and we want to make your experience with it as intuitive as possible. Here are our latest updates to the **Branches** page:

- Made it easier to create child branches by adding a clear-as-day **Create child branch** button to the detailed Branches view. It's still an option under the Actions dropdown, but now you've got the can't-miss button too.

- Easier navigation from your listed database on the **Roles and databases** tab to the Drizzle Studio-based **Tables** page, where you can explore and modify your data directly. The actions kebab also includes options to delete your database, as well as navigate to the SQL Editor, and we preserve your database selection as you travel.

- We've changed the metric displayed on the **Branches** page from **active hours** to the more helpful **compute hours** metric, giving you a better sense of how much compute resources a given branch is consuming. For more details about consumption metrics, see [Usage metrics](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics).

### Even more protection

Last week, we introduced protection against accidentally deleting protected branches. This week, we've added more safeguards:

- **Resetting Protected Branches:** We now prevent you from using **Reset from parent** on protected branches (often your production branch) unless you unprotect the branch first.

### Fixes & improvements

- Fixed a misleading item in our Quickstart, where we told you that your compute had already started while it was still in transition. Trying to connect in that state would fail. Now, when you see your compute has started, it is definitely started. You can grab your connection string and go.
- The Neon CLI `ip-allow` command's `--primary-only` option was deprecated and replaced by a `--protected-only` option. Additionally, in the Neon API, the `primary_branch_only` option in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Update project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) methods was deprecated and replaced by the `protected_branches_only` option. The deprecated options will be removed in a future release.

  These are follow-up changes associated with the renaming of "primary branches" to "default branches" that we implemented recently and announced in the [June 21, 2024 changelog](/docs/changelog/2024-06-21).
