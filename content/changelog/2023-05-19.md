### Autoscaling support for fractional compute sizes

Neon's Autoscaling feature now supports fractional (1/4 and 1/2) minimum compute sizes. Previously, the minimum compute size for autoscaling was 1.

Autoscaling is a [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature. For configuration instructions, see [Compute size and autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).

### Free Tier "Billing" page

Added a **Billing** page to the Neon Console where Free Tier users can view [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) limits and learn about the benefits of upgrading to the [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan). The **Billing** page is accessible from the sidebar in the Neon Console.

### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Implemented minor copy, stylistic, and functional improvements for the **Request Downgrade** modal accessed from the **Billing** page.
- API: Disabled `docker` as a compute provisioning option in the Neon [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Create endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) APIs. This option is not supported with the Neon cloud service.
