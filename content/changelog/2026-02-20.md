## Europe (Frankfurt): update allowlists and VPC configuration

We've expanded infrastructure capacity in the AWS Europe (Frankfurt) region. If you have IP allowlists on external systems that Neon connects to, or if you use Private Networking in this region, **update your allowlists or VPC endpoint configuration** to include any new addresses. See our [Regions documentation](/docs/introduction/regions#aws-nat-gateway-ip-addresses) for the complete list of NAT gateway IPs and the [Private Networking guide](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) for VPC endpoint service addresses by region.
