## Automatic cache prewarming for compute updates

To apply [updates](/docs/manage/updates) to your Neon compute (Postgres upgrades, security patches, and the like), we restart the compute where Postgres runs during your [update window](/docs/manage/updates#updates-on-paid-plans). The restart itself typically takes only a few seconds, but in-memory caches are left cold, which can impact query performance until they warm up again.

To protect performance, we now prewarm your compute's cache during the update process without affecting restart times. There are no additional compute or storage costs associated with this enhancement. In the coming weeks, cache prewarming will roll out to all read/write computes, with read replica computes to follow.

For the technical details, see our blog post: [Improving database upgrades with prewarming](BLOG_POST_URL_PLACEHOLDER).

## Connect modal defaults to Connection string

Developers told us they want to quickly copy the database connection string to drop into their application. Based on that feedback, the **Connect** modal on the project dashboard now defaults to **Connection string** in the snippet dropdown instead of the psql command. You can still choose any snippet from the dropdown (e.g., psql), and your preferred option is saved for the next time you open the **Connect** modal.

## Cursor plugin for Neon

The **Neon Cursor plugin** is now available. It adds Neon Skills and MCP integration to Cursor so your assistant can use workflow guidance (connection methods, ORMs, branching) and run database operations from natural language, including listing projects, creating branches, running SQL, and more. In Cursor chat, run `/add-plugin neon-postgres`, or run `/add-plugin` and search for **neon**. The plugin appears as **Neon Postgres** in the Add Plugin menu:

After installation, prompt with "Get started with Neon" to complete authentication. For setup and usage, see [Cursor plugin for Neon](/docs/ai/ai-cursor-plugin).

## Expanded infrastructure capacity in AWS Europe (Frankfurt)

We've expanded infrastructure capacity in the AWS Europe (Frankfurt) region (`aws-eu-central-1`). If you have IP allowlists on external systems that Neon connects to, or if you use Private Networking in this region, **update your allowlists or VPC endpoint configuration** to include any new addresses. See our [Regions documentation](/docs/introduction/regions#aws-nat-gateway-ip-addresses) for the complete list of NAT gateway IPs and the [Private Networking guide](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) for VPC endpoint service addresses by region.

## Neon CircleCI Orb: a Postgres branch for every pipeline run

A new community-contributed **Neon CircleCI Orb** provisions a Neon database branch per job, so your CI database is production-like in behavior with fewer "works in CI, breaks in prod" surprises. Each run gets an isolated, ephemeral branch. You can branch from a pre-migrated base to skip running migrations from scratch. The orb handles cleanup and TTL when the job ends. Because each run has its own branch, tests stay deterministic and parallel runs don't share state. Example:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  neon: dhanushreddy291/neon@1.0

workflows:
  test_workflow:
    jobs:
      - neon/run_tests:
          migrate_command: npm run db:migrate
          test_command: npm test
```

See the [Automate branching with CircleCI](/docs/guides/branching-circleci) guide to get started. The guide covers the `neon/run_tests` job and the `neon/create_branch`, `neon/delete_branch`, and `neon/reset_branch` commands.
