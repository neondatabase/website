## Automatic prewarming for compute updates — no more cold caches

To apply [updates](/docs/manage/updates) to your Neon compute (Postgres upgrades, security patches, and the like), we restart the compute. The restart itself typically takes only a few seconds. After a restart, though, in-memory caches are cold, so the database can be slow until caches warm up again. That slowdown can be enough to cause timeouts and feel like an availability hit, not just a performance dip.

To address this performance gap, we now bring up a new compute shortly before your update window, prewarm its cache from the same data your compute was using, and keep it in sync. When the new compute is ready with the latest updates and prewarmed cache, we switch traffic to it so your workload sees only a brief cutover instead of a long period of cold cache. You still choose your [update window](/docs/manage/updates#updates-on-paid-plans). There are no additional compute or storage costs associated with this new feature. In the coming weeks, all update restarts for read/write computes will use this flow by default. Read replica computes will follow.

For the full story, benchmarks, and technical details, see our blog post: [Improving database upgrades with prewarming](BLOG_POST_URL_PLACEHOLDER).

## Europe (Frankfurt): Update allowlists and VPC configuration

We've expanded infrastructure capacity in the AWS Europe (Frankfurt) region. If you have IP allowlists on external systems that Neon connects to, or if you use Private Networking in this region, **update your allowlists or VPC endpoint configuration** to include any new addresses. See our [Regions documentation](/docs/introduction/regions#aws-nat-gateway-ip-addresses) for the complete list of NAT gateway IPs and the [Private Networking guide](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) for VPC endpoint service addresses by region.

## Neon Auth updates and enhancements

You can now configure **Organizations** for Neon Auth from the Neon Console. In your project, open **Auth** in the sidebar and go to the **Configuration** tab to find the new Organizations section. You can enable or disable organizations, set a maximum number of organizations per user, allow or disallow users to create organizations, and choose the default role for organization creators (admin or owner). These settings support multi-tenant apps where users create and join organizations.

We also fixed an issue where deleting a database with Neon Auth left stale state and caused 500 errors when opening Neon Auth settings (e.g., OAuth or SMTP).

## Connect modal defaults to Connection string

The **Connect to your database** modal on the project dashboard now defaults to **Connection string** in the connection snippet dropdown (it previously defaulted to the psql command), so you can copy the connection string for your application without switching. You can still choose any snippet from the dropdown (e.g., psql). Your selection is saved for the next time you open the modal.

## Cursor plugin for Neon

The **Neon Cursor plugin** is now available. It adds Neon Skills and MCP integration to Cursor so your assistant can use workflow guidance (connection methods, ORMs, branching) and run database operations from natural language. In Cursor chat, run:

```text
/add-plugin neon-postgres
```

Then prompt with "Get started with Neon" to complete authentication. For setup and usage, see [Cursor plugin for Neon](/docs/ai/ai-cursor-plugin).
