## Deploy a global cache with Neon's PolyScale integration

![Polyscale integration card](/docs/relnotes/neon_polyscale.jpg)

We are pleased to announce the launch of Neon's PolyScale integration. [PolyScale](https://docs.polyscale.ai/) allows you to easily cache your data globally through its low-latency regional edge network. Enjoy benefits like speedy accces to your data from anywhere in the world, reduced load on your database, and improved slow query performance. A PolyScale global cache is also an alternative to cross-regional replication without the added complexity. No coding or infrastructure changes are required to use PolyScale. You can have it up and running in just a few minutes. Like Neon, PolyScale offers a free plan. No credit card is required.

To get started:

1. Navigate to your project in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
2. Select the **Integrations** page from the sidebar.
3. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Add**.

For detailed instructions, refer to our [PolyScale integration](/docs/guides/polyscale-integration) guide.

### Fixes & improvements

Implemented the following improvements to the **Connection Details** widget, which is accessed from your Neon project **Dashboard**:

- Added tab support for providing multiple code snippet examples per language or framework
- Added **Connection string** and **Parameters only** code snippets
- Fixed the highlighting for the Java code snippet
