### New Monitoring widget on the Dashboard

We've added a **Monitoring** widget to the Neon **Dashboard**, giving you an easy way to check CPU and RAM usage for your Neon projects. The display defaults to your project's default branch but you can switch to view usage details for any branch in your project.

We're committed to improving observability for your Neon projects and databases. To learn more about monitoring in Neon, see [Monitoring](/docs/introduction/monitoring).

### A teaser for organizations

You might notice a new addition to our breadcrumb navigation: **Create organization** under your account selector. It's greyed out and inactive for now, but we've included it here as a reminder: organization support is coming soon!

### PostgreSQL Partition Manager extension

Neon now supports the [pg_partman](/docs/extensions/pg_partman) partition manager extension, which enables creating and managing time and number-based table partition sets in Postgres.

### Local File Cache (LFC) statistics and working set size function

You can now view Local File Cache (LFC) statistics for your Neon compute. The statistics include a cache hit ratio, which can help you determine if your data is being accessed from memory or the Neon storage layer.

The Local File Cache (LFC) stores frequently accessed data in the local memory of your Neon compute instance, which helps reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing fetches from storage. The LFC acts as an add-on or extension of Postgres `shared_buffers`, which is set to 128 MB in Neon, regardless of compute size. The LFC extends cache memory to as much as 75% of your compute's RAM.

Local File Cache (LFC) statistics are exposed through a `neon_stat_file_cache view`, provided by the `neon` extension. To access the view, install the `neon` extension on a preferred database or connect to the Neon-managed `postgres` database where it's preinstalled. For instructions, see [The neon extension](/docs/extensions/neon).

You can retrieve LFC stats with the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM neon_stat_file_cache;
 file_cache_misses | file_cache_hits | file_cache_used | file_cache_writes | file_cache_hit_ratio
-------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------
           2133643 |       108999742 |             607 |          10767410 |                98.08
```

You can also use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with the `FILECACHE` option to view data for LFC hits and misses. See [View LFC metrics with EXPLAIN ANALYZE](/docs/extensions/neon#view-lfc-metrics-with-explain-analyze).

To learn how LFC data can help you right-size your compute, see [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

### Fixes & improvements

- For the [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver), the 15-second proxy timeout for SQL requests over HTTP has been removed.
