title: Safer project deletes, LFC-enabled autoscaling, and more
---

### Safer project deletes

We've heard you. Where it might have felt just a little _too_ easy to delete a project &#8212; along with its branches, databases, and roles &#8212; we've added a bit more friction to the process. You now have to type out the name of your project by hand before you can delete.

### Local File Cache (LFC)-aware autoscaling

As we continue to mature our Autoscaling offering, we've rolled out LFC-aware autoscaling to all regions.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/docs/relnotes/autoscaling_real.png" alt="Alt text" />
  <p style={{ marginTop: '-15px', fontSize: '80%' }}><em>One hour of real-time autoscaling from a selection of your databases.</em></p>
</div>

The idea behind this feature is to improve performance by keeping your entire working set (a subset of frequently accessed or recently used data) in memory. We already [recommend](/docs/manage/endpoints#sizing-your-compute-based-on-the-working-set) this in the docs, and we've now made it a native part of how autoscaling works: your compute now dynamically resizes to fit your working set within the LFC.

If you're not familiar with Neon's Local File Cache (LFC), you can learn more about it here: [What is the Local File Cache?](/docs/extensions/neon#what-is-the-local-file-cache)

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- The authorization flow initiated by `neon auth` now asks for additional permissions. This update is part of the groundwork for the upcoming Early Access release for Organization accounts. Stay tuned!
- We now dynamically set the maximum size of the LFC (Local File Cache) according to your compute's max vCPU. Previously, the max size was set to a static 100 GiB, which sometimes caused compute to run out of space in the LFC disk.
- We've renamed our **Free Tier** to **Free Plan** everywhere: our website, our docs, and our console.
- Fixed a mismatch between a selected timezone range (UTC) and the local timezone showing on different graphs on the Monitoring page, which sometimes caused misleading reports or missing data.
