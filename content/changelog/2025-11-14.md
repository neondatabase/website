## Data masking (Beta)

Neon now offers a data masking feature that makes it easy to create anonymized branches for development and testing. Define masking rules through the Neon Console or API to protect sensitive data like email addresses, names, phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information. Apply these rules to create a branch with production-like data that's safe to share with your team.

This feature uses the PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension (`anon`) under the hood.

For more information, see [Data anonymization](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization).

## Branch auto-deletion enabled by default

When creating branches in the Neon Console, auto-delete is now enabled by default (set to 1 day). This helps keep your project organized while still letting you adjust or disable it during creation.

> **Console only**: This change only affects branches created through the Neon Console. Branches created via API or CLI are unaffected.

This change will be rolled out to all Console users in the coming days.

## MCP Server enhancements

We've added several powerful capabilities to the Neon MCP Server:

- **Search across resources** - You can now search across all your Neon resources with a single query. Ask your AI assistant:

  ```
  Can you search for "production" across my Neon resources?
  ```

  The assistant will search through organizations, projects, and branches, returning structured results with direct links to the Neon Console. Use the companion `fetch` tool to get detailed information about any resource.

- **Read-only mode** - We've added read-only mode for safe operation in cloud and production environments. Enable it by adding the `x-read-only: true` header to your MCP configuration:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "Neon": {
        "url": "https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp",
        "headers": {
          "x-read-only": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  When enabled, the server restricts all operations to read-only tools. Only list and describe tools are available, and SQL queries automatically run in read-only transactions, providing a safe method for querying and analyzing production databases without any risk of accidental modifications.

- **Guided onboarding** - The new `load_resource` tool provides comprehensive getting-started guidance directly through your AI assistant. Ask "Get started with Neon" or "Help me set up my first project," and the assistant will load detailed instructions covering organization setup, project configuration, connection strings, schema creation, and migrations. This works in IDEs that don't fully support MCP resources and ensures onboarding guidance is explicitly loaded when you need it.

For more information, see [Neon MCP Server](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server).

## WebSocket connection reliability improvements

We've improved WebSocket connection stability for long-running queries and edge runtime environments. The serverless proxy now sends keepalive signals using Postgres protocol messages during idle periods, providing better compatibility with edge runtimes like Vercel Edge Runtime that have limited WebSocket implementations. This helps prevent connection timeouts during idle periods, particularly for users running long-duration queries or using edge runtime deployments.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console:**
  - The AI assistant and support options are now separated in the Resources menu for easier navigation, with support resources tailored to your plan.
  - Branch usage metrics now display more accurate consumption data using `written_size_since_parent_bytes` from the new consumption endpoint.
  - Deleted resource slugs (projects, branches, endpoints) can now be immediately reused for new resources.
  - Snapshot schedule improvements: added validation messages, improved validation logic to prevent invalid configurations, and explicitly display UTC for snapshot hour to remove timezone ambiguity.
  - The "Edit schedule" button is now hidden for non-root branches, since backup schedules can only be set on root branches.
  - The "Add compute" button now displays consistently across all relevant pages.
  - The JSON schema API endpoint now correctly excludes database views from responses.

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.2.7. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Neon CLI:**
  - The `neon branches list` command now displays visual indicators (✱ for default, ⛨ for protected, [anon] for anonymized branches) directly in the output, making it easier to identify branch characteristics at a glance.

- **Compute:**
  - Reduced configuration-related log noise by always creating the configuration file (even when empty), eliminating repeated "skipping missing configuration file..." messages.
