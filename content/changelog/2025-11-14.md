title: Data masking, Read-Only mode for MCP Server, branch auto-deletion, and more
---

## Data masking (Beta)

Neon now offers a data masking feature that makes it easy to create anonymized branches for development and testing. Define masking rules through the Neon Console or API to protect sensitive data like email addresses, names, phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information. Apply these rules to create a branch with production-like data that's safe to share with your team.

This feature uses the PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension (`anon`) under the hood.

For more information, see [Data anonymization](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization).

## Branch auto-deletion enabled by default

When creating a branch in the Neon Console, auto-delete is now enabled by default (set to 1 day). You can uncheck this option or adjust the timeframe as needed. This new default helps reduce storage costs and prevent the accumulation of unused branches.

**Console only:** This change only affects branches created through the Neon Console. Branches created via API or CLI are unaffected.

This change will be rolled out to all Console users in the coming days.

## More MCP Server tools

We've added several new capabilities to the Neon MCP Server:

- **Search across resources** - You can now search across all your Neon resources with a single query. Ask your AI assistant:

  ```
  Can you search for "production" across my Neon resources?
  ```

  The assistant will search through organizations, projects, and branches, returning structured results with direct links to the Neon Console. Use the companion `fetch` tool to get detailed information about any resource.

- **Read-only mode** - We've added read-only mode for safe operation in cloud and production environments. Enable it by adding the `x-read-only: true` header to your MCP configuration:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "Neon": {
        "url": "https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp",
        "headers": {
          "x-read-only": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  When enabled, the server restricts all operations to read-only tools. Only list and describe tools are available, and SQL queries automatically run in read-only transactions, providing a safe method for querying and analyzing production databases without any risk of accidental modifications.

- **Guided onboarding** - The new `load_resource` tool provides comprehensive getting-started guidance directly through your AI assistant. Ask "Get started with Neon" or "Help me set up my first project," and the assistant will load detailed instructions covering organization setup, project configuration, connection strings, schema creation, and migrations. This works in IDEs that don't fully support MCP resources and ensures onboarding guidance is explicitly loaded when you need it.

For more information, see [Neon MCP Server](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server).

## WebSocket connection reliability improvements

WebSocket connections are now more stable during long-running queries and in edge runtime environments. The serverless proxy now prevents connection timeouts during idle periods, particularly benefiting applications with long-duration queries, analytics workloads, or deployments on edge runtimes like Vercel Edge Runtime.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console:**
  - The AI assistant and support options are now separated in the Resources menu for easier navigation, with support resources tailored to your plan.
  - The usage metrics panel on the **Branch overview** page now shows more accurate network transfer data for that branch.
  - Backup schedule improvements: schedule setup now provides clearer error messages to help you avoid invalid configurations, and the snapshot hour is now explicitly shown in UTC to eliminate timezone confusion. The **Edit schedule** button no longer appears for child branches since backup schedules can only be configured on root branches.

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.2.7. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
