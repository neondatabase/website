## Self-serve HIPAA compliance

You can now enable HIPAA compliance for your Neon projects directly through the console, without needing to contact support. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a federal law that sets national standards for protecting health information, making it essential for healthcare applications that handle Protected Health Information (PHI). This feature is available as part of our Scale plan and requires a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Learn more about [HIPAA compliance on Neon](https://neon.com/docs/security/hipaa).
