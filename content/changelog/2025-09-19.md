## Snapshot APIs for database versioning (Beta)

We're excited to introduce our new snapshot APIs, designed for AI agent and code generation platforms that need robust database versioning capabilities. With snapshots, you can create point-in-time database versions, perform instant rollbacks, and maintain stable database connection strings throughout your development workflow. This powerful feature enables AI agents to safely experiment with database changes while preserving the ability to quickly revert to previous stable states. The snapshot APIs support both production rollbacks (using the active branch pattern) and temporary preview branches for testing changes. Check out our [database versioning guide](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-database-versioning) and explore the [demonstration repository](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/snapshots-as-checkpoints-demo) to see the complete implementation. Read more in our blog post: [Building AI Agents with Neon's snapshot APIs](#) (TBD).

## Free plan compute hours increased to 100 hours

We've heard your feedback loud and clear! We're excited to announce that we've increased the Free plan compute hour limit from 50 hours to 100 hours per month. This means you can now run your projects for twice as long each month without any additional cost. Whether you're prototyping new applications, learning PostgreSQL, or building your next side project, you'll have more time to focus on what matters most â€” creating amazing applications. Thank you for your continued feedback as we work to make Neon the best platform for your development needs.

## Self-serve HIPAA compliance

You can now enable HIPAA compliance for your Neon projects directly through the console, without needing to contact support. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a federal law that sets national standards for protecting health information, making it essential for healthcare applications that handle Protected Health Information (PHI). This feature is available as part of our Scale plan and requires a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Learn more about [HIPAA compliance on Neon](https://neon.com/docs/security/hipaa).
