🎉 **Happy New Year, everyone!** 🎉

We're excited to kick off 2025 and let you know that we're shipping again! 🚢 Here's to an amazing year ahead. Let's go!

### A new default Postgres version for newly created Neon projects

![Create PG17 project](/docs/relnotes/create_project_17.png)

Postgres 17 is now the default for newly created Neon projects. Neon continues to support Postgres 14, 15, and 16 if you prefer to stick with those. For Neon's Postgres version support policy, see [Postgres Version Support](https://neon.tech/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).

### Support for the Postgres pg_cron extension

The Postgres `pg_cron` extension is now available on paid Neon plans upon request. This extension lets you schedule and manage periodic jobs directly in your Postgres database. To enable `pg_cron`, [open a support ticket](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support) and include your endpoint ID and the database name where you'd like the extension enabled. A compute restart will be required to make it available.

### Higher connection limits for autoscaling configurations

In Postgres, the `max_connections` setting controls the maximum number of simultaneous client connections the database server can handle. In Neon, this setting is configured based on your compute size. With Neon's autoscaling feature, `max_connections` is now defined by your maximum compute size rather than your minimum compute size.

This change significantly increases connection limits for autoscaling configurations. For example, consider an autoscaling configuration with these minimum and maximum compute sizes:

- **Minium**: 2 CU compute size — supports up to 901 connections
- **Maximum**: 8 CU compute size — supports up to 3604 connections

Previously, this autoscaling configuration of 2 CU ↔ 8 CU was limited to 901 connections. Now, the same configuration allows up to 3604 connections.

### The PgBouncer default_pool_size now scales

Neon supports connection pooling with [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/). Previously, Neon's PgBouncer configuration set the `default_pool_size` to a fixed value of `64`, which limited Postgres connections to 64 per user/database pair, regardless of the compute size.

Now, the `default_pool_size` is dynamically set to `0.9 * max_connections`, enabling significantly more concurrent Postgres connections per user/database pair. Note that larger compute sizes benefit from higher `max_connections` limits, which result in a proportionally larger `default_pool_size`.

For example, on an 8 CU compute with a `max_connections` limit of 3604, the `default_pool_size` increases from 64 to 3243 (`0.9 × 3604`).

### More support for AI agents

Neon is now available as a tool for AI agents on both **AgentStack** and **Composio**.

[AgentStack](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/AgentStack) let's you create AI agent projects from the command line. The Neon tool allows agents to create ephemeral or long-lived Postgres instances for structured data storage. View the Neon tool [here](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/AgentStack/blob/main/agentstack/templates/crewai/tools/neon_tool.py) to see how an AI agent can create a Neon database in less than 500 ms, connect to the database, and run SQL DDL and DML statements.

```python
@tool("Create Neon Project and Database")
def create_database(project_name: str) -> str:
  """
  Creates a new Neon project. (this takes less than 500ms)
  Args:
      project_name: Name of the project to create
  Returns:
      the connection URI for the new project
  """
  try:
      project = neon_client.project_create(project={"name": project_name}).project
      connection_uri = neon_client.connection_uri(
          project_id=project.id, database_name="neondb", role_name="neondb_owner"
      ).uri
      return f"Project/database created, connection URI: {connection_uri}"
  except Exception as e:
      return f"Failed to create project: {str(e)}"
```

[Composio](https://composio.dev/) lets you connect 200+ tools to AI Agents — and it now supports Neon, enabling full integration between LLMs and AI agents and Neon's API.

### Neon Auth.js adapter

We've introduced an [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) adapter for Neon, which enables storing user and session data in your Neon database. For adapter installation and setup instructions, see [Neon Adapter](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters/neon) in the Auth.js docs.

### "Perplexity mode" for the Docs

We’ve added an AI-powered "perplexity mode" to the [Neon Docs](https://neon.tech/ai-chat) site, providing a conversational interface to quickly get the answers you need.

![Perlexity mode for docs](/docs/relnotes/perplexity-mode.png)

Our AI chat assistant is built on a variety of sources including the Neon Docs, the Neon Discord Server, and API docs — and it's updated daily.

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Console updates**

  We adjusted billing period start dates in the console to align with the beginning of the current month. Previously, timezone differences could cause the start date to display as the last day of the previous month.

- **Virtual Private Networking**

  Fixed an issue where invalid VPC endpoint IDs would not be deleted. Invalid endpoint IDs are now transitioned to a deleted state after 24 hours and automatically removed at a later date.

- **Neon API**

  The [List branches](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectbranches) endpoint now supports sorting and pagination with the addition of `sort_by`, `sort_order`, `limit`, and `cursor` query parameters. The `sorted by` options include `updated_at`, `created_at`, or `name`, and `sort_order` options include `asc` and `desc`. After an initial call, pagination support lets you list the next or previous number of branches specified by the `limit` parameter.

- **Neon API Client**

  The [TypeScript SDK for the Neon API](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/typescript-sdk) was updated to a new version (1.11.4). The new version adds support for creating organization API keys.

- **Logical Replication**

  Before dropping a database, Neon now drops any logical replication subscriptions defined in the database.

- **Fixes**

  Fixed an issue that permitted installing the Neon GitHub integration for organizations or personal accounts where the integration was already installed.
