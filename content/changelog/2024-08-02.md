title: Introducing the Neon GitHub integration, password protection for protected branches, improvements for Free Plan users, and more
---

### GitHub integration

We've opened up a new feature to all users. Our **GitHub integration** includes a GitHub app that you can use to connect your Neon projects to GitHub repos.

![Neon GitHub integration](/docs/relnotes/github_integration.png)

This new integration makes it easy to:

- Automatically create a database branch with each pull request.
- Build GitHub Actions workflows that interact with Neon. To help you get started, we provide a sample workflow that you can customize.

How it works, in a nutshell:

- **Install the GitHub App** &#8212; the integration installs a GitHub app that you'll use to select repositories you want to connect to Neon.
- **Set up variables** &#8212; the integration sets up a Neon API key secret and a Neon project ID variable in the selected GitHub repository.
- **Create workflows** &#8212; you can then use GitHub Actions to integrate database branching with your workflow for preview environments, testing, and more.

To get started, follow the instructions in our [GitHub Integration](/docs/guides/neon-github-integration) guide.

We'll be expanding on this feature in future releases. If you have requests or feedback about what you'd like to see in the next update, let us know via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or our [feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042) on Discord.

## Password protection for protected branches

When you create a child branch from a protected branch, new passwords are generated for the Postgres roles on the child branch.

This behavior is designed to prevent the exposure of passwords that could be used to access your protected branch. For example, if you designate a production branch as protected, the newly generated passwords for Postgres roles on child branches ensure that you're not exposing product branch credentials in your development and test branches.

The protected branches feature is available with the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan. To learn more, refer to our [Protected branches guide](/docs/guides/protected-branches).

<Admonition type="note">
If your CI scripts create branches from protected branches, please be aware that passwords for Postgres roles on those newly created branches will now differ. If you depend on those passwords being the same, you'll need to make adjustments to get the correct connection details for those branches. For more, refer to our [Protected branches guide](/docs/guides/protected-branches).

## Improvements for our Free Plan users

For our Free Plan users, we've made a couple of updates to make it easier to track and manage plan allowances:

- We added a **Data transfer** section to the **Billing** page in the Neon Console so that you can easily monitor all of your plan allowances in one place. Data transfer is the total volume of data transferred out of Neon (also referred to as "egress") during a given billing period. Neon does not charge for data transfer, but there's a 5 GB per month allowance on the Free Plan. For more, see [Data transfer](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#data-transfer).
- We updated the **Resources remaining widget** on the Project Dashboard. The **Compute time since** metric has been renamed to **Branch compute time**. This metric shows the number of compute hours remaining for branch computes in the current billing period. The Free Plan offers an allowance of 5 compute hours per month on branch computes in addition to 24/7 availability on the default branch compute.

## Drizzle Studio updates for our Tables page

We've updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. Among other updates, this new version of Drizzle Studio brings the following improvements:

- Support for materialized views
- Improved filtering behavior (filtering now occurs when you click **Apply**)
- The ability to paste a value into a cell without double-clicking
- Delete and update support for tables without a primary key. If there is no primary key, a unique constraint is required. A NULL check is performed if a unique constraint is nullable.

- A new **Logical replication** page is now available under **Settings** in the Neon Console. This is where you can enable logical replication for your Neon project. Neon's logical replication feature lets you stream data from Neon to external data platforms and services. For more, see [Get started with logical replication](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide).
- Resolved a problem with the [Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel) where enabling [automatic branch deletion](/docs/guides/vercel#automatic-deletion) resulted in the unintended removal of a preview branch after the branch was renamed via the Neon Console. Please be aware that renaming preview branches created by the Neon Vercel Integration before this release could still result in automatic branch deletion if that feature is enabled.
- We added a warning to the **Settings** &#8594; **Storage** page. The warning appears when you select a history retention period greater than 1 day. Your project's history is a log of changes (inserts, updates, and deletes). It enables features like point-in-time restore and time travel connections. However, it can also increase your project's storage, depending on the amount of data changes and how much history you keep. For more, see [Storage](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#storage).
