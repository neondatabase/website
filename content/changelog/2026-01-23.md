## Neon Agent Skills for AI coding assistants

Give your AI coding assistant expert knowledge about working with Neon. We've published [neondatabase/agent-skills](https://github.com/neondatabase/agent-skills), which teaches AI assistants Neon best practices, connection methods, ORM setup, and branching workflows. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and Windsurf.

```bash
npx skills add neondatabase/agent-skills
```

Agent Skills work alongside the [Neon MCP Server](/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon)—the skill provides reasoning and guidance while the MCP server provides capabilities like creating branches and running queries. Learn more in our [blog post on Agent Skills](https://neon.com/blog/agent-skills-2026).

<summary>**Neon Auth**</summary>

- Added session data cookie caching to reduce API calls to the Auth Server by 95-99%. When enabled, `neonAuthMiddleware` and server-side methods (`neonAuth`, `authServer.getSession`) use a local session cache cookie for validation with a 5-minute TTL. To enable, set the `NEON_AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET` environment variable (minimum 32 characters). See [Neon Auth documentation](/docs/auth/overview).

# Neon MCP Server: Provision the Neon Data API

The [Neon MCP Server](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server) now supports provisioning the [Neon Data API](/docs/data-api/overview) for your databases with optional JWT authentication. Ask your AI assistant:

```bash
Can you provision Data API access for my database with Neon Auth authentication?
```

The `provision_neon_data_api` tool enables HTTP-based access to your Neon databases and supports multiple authentication options: unauthenticated access, Neon Auth, or external providers (Clerk, Auth0, Stytch, and others). This makes it easier to set up [Data API](/docs/data-api/overview) access directly from your AI assistant without switching to the Neon Console.

For more information, see [Neon MCP Server](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server).

## Postgres 18 protocol support available

Neon now supports [Postgres 18's protocol 3.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-overview.html#PROTOCOL-VERSIONS) with enhanced cancellation keys. This protocol support applies retroactively to all Postgres versions (14, 15, 16, 17, and 18). Clients that support the new protocol will automatically benefit from these improvements without any configuration changes needed.

<summary>**Consumption API**</summary>

- We increased the burst limit for our [Consumption API](/docs/guides/consumption-metrics) endpoints. The higher limit allows for temporary spikes in request volume, making it easier to handle periods of high activity without hitting rate limits.

_The Consumption API lets Scale and Enterprise plan users track resource usage (compute time, storage, data transfer) across projects programmatically._

<summary>**Import Data Assistant**</summary>

- Fixed an issue where the [Import Data Assistant](/docs/import/import-data-assistant) would get stuck after creating a new project, preventing users from completing the import workflow.

_The Import Data Assistant is an automated tool that helps you move your existing database to Neon using just a connection string._
