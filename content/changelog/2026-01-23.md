## MCP server: Provision the Neon Data API

Our MCP server now supports provisioning the Neon Data API for your databases with optional JWT authentication.

<!-- PR #178: https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon/pull/178 --> Ask your AI assistant:

```
Can you provision Data API access for my database with Clerk authentication?
```

The `provision_neon_data_api` tool enables HTTP-based access to your Neon databases and supports multiple authentication options: unauthenticated access, Neon Auth, or external providers (Clerk, Auth0, Stytch, and others). The tool intelligently resolves default branch and database settings when not specified and returns the existing API URL if already provisioned. This makes it easier to set up Data API access directly from your AI assistant without switching to the Neon Console.

For more information, see [Neon MCP Server](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server).

## Postgres extensions

The **Neon extension** has been updated to **version 1.14**.

<!-- PR #3582: https://github.com/databricks-eng/hadron/pull/3582 --> This release adds support for autoscaling state transfer during replica promotion. The extension now includes `get_hll_state()` and `replace_hll()` SQL functions that enable automatic transfer of working set estimation data from primary to replica instances, ensuring consistent autoscaling behavior across HA operations. For more information, see the [Neon extension documentation](/docs/extensions/neon).

## Postgres 18 protocol support available

Neon now supports **Postgres 18's protocol 3.2** with enhanced cancellation keys. This provides better connection security and management. When connecting to Postgres 18 instances (currently in preview), clients that support the new protocol will automatically benefit from these improvements without any configuration changes needed.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Console**
  - We've refreshed the **Getting Started widgets** with a better design and improved user experience. The updated components now take up less space, feature cleaner cards with better visual hierarchy, and include a new card for the project initialization modal. This makes it easier for new users to connect to their Neon databases faster.
  - Fixed an issue where the database import assistant would get stuck during project creation.
  - Updated Neon logos across the Console to match our latest branding.
  - Improved Vercel integration cleanup so that Neon Auth integrations are properly removed when branches are deleted or webhooks are cleaned up.
