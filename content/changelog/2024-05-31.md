### Anonymize sensitive data with Neon and Neosync

We are excited to announce that Neon has partnered with [Neosync](https://www.neosync.dev/) to provide developers with a complete solution for branching Postgres databases with anonymized data. Neosync is an open-source platform that helps developers anonymize production data and sync it across their environments for a better developer experience.

Both Neon and Neosync offer generous free tiers. If youâ€™re interested in trying it out, follow the steps in our [Neosync guide](/docs/guides/neosync-anonymize) to get started.

### Join the Neon Early Access Program from the Neon Console

You can now join the **Neon Early Access Program** directly from the Neon Console to be among the first to try new Neon features. From your **Profile** menu, select **Account Settings** > **Early Access**, and submit your Discord username.

The benefits of joining include:

- **Private community**: Gain access to a dedicated Discord channel to connect with the Neon team and provide feedback to help shape what comes next.
- **Weekly insights**: Receive updates on Neon's latest developments and future plans.

### Fixes & improvements

- Improved the text on the **Billing** page in the Neon Console to better explain compute usage and allowances for each of Neon's plans.
- Added a **Home** button to the Neon login page to provide a means of navigating to the Neon website if that was the intended destination.
- Updated the Drizzle Studio version that supports the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. The new version fixes a display issue for long `BIGINT` values.
- Improved the design of **Billing summary** section on the **Billing** page in the Neon Console to make it easier to understand your current billing status.
- Addressed an issue with the [Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel) that prevented the [automatic branch deletion](/docs/guides/vercel#automatic-deletion) feature from removing Neon branches after merging the corresponding Git branch.
- Custom-built extension support is now an Enterprise plan feature only. Any custom-built extensions that we currently support are not affected by this change and will continue to be supported on your current plan.
