### Documentation updates

- Added a [Billing](/docs/introduction/about-billing) page describing Neon paid plans, pricing, and related topics.
- Added instructions for using the [Neon Serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) on Vercel Edge Functions and Cloudflare Workers. The driver is a drop-in replacement for [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) that allows you to query data from environments that support WebSockets but not TCP sockets.
- Added an [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk) reference page, which provides links to community-created SDKs for interacting with the Neon API. Community-created SDKs include:

  - [Go SDK](https://github.com/kislerdm/neon-sdk-go)
  - [Node and Deno TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/paambaati/neon-js-sdk)

  Thanks to [Dmitry Kisler](https://github.com/kislerdm) and [Ganesh Prasannah](https://github.com/paambaati) for the contributions.

- Updated the [Neon Docs](/docs/introduction) landing page. The new landing page provides a visual interface for navigating the Neon documentation site.
- Added an [RSS feed](/docs/changelog/rss.xml) for the Neon Changelog.
- Redirected old Neon API reference links to the new [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
- Updated various [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) style elements to align styles with the [Neon Docs](/docs/introduction) site.
- Updated the query example in the Neon Console onboarding banner and in the [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) topic in the documentation. The `CREATE TABLE` statement did not include a primary key, which prevented the data from being edited when accessed from pgAdmin.
