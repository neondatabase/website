Neon is now available in the **Asia Pacific (Sydney)** region.

You can select the region for your Neon project during project creation. See [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

For information about the regions Neon supports, see [Regions](/docs/introduction/regions).

### Postgres extension update for plv8

We updated the `plv8` extension to version 3.1.10. If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.

`plv8` is a Javascript language extension for Postgres. To learn more, refer to the [PLV8 documentation](https://plv8.github.io/). For a list of all Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Supported Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

### Vercel integration enhancements

The following updates were made to the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon):

- Preview deployment branches are now created from the [default branch](/docs/reference/glossary#default-branch) of your Neon project. Previously, the integration created branches from the [root branch](/docs/reference/glossary#root-branch) of your Neon project, which is designated as your project's default branch by default. Neon lets you [change your default branch](/docs/manage/branches#set-a-branch-as-default). If you have an older version of the integration and you want branches created from your project's default branch instead of root, reinstall the integration from the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations).
- The integration now appends the `sslmode=require` option to the Neon connection string that it sets for the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in Vercel.
- Fixed an issue that prevented using the integration with more than one Vercel project.
- Fixed an issue that set the `DATABASE_URL` variable in the Vercel project settings to a pooled Neon database connection string instead of a direct database connection string.

### Fixes & improvements

- Free Tier users with access to a project shared by a Neon Pro Plan account can now submit support requests via the **Support** link in the Neon Console sidebar.
- Fixed an issue that caused shared projects to be displayed under **Projects** instead of **Shared with me** on the **Projects** page in the Neon Console.
- The **Edit compute** modal, accessed via the **Branches** page in the Neon Console, was reimplemented as a side drawer.
