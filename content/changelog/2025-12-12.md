title: Introducing the new Neon Auth
---

## Neon Auth: branchable identity in your database

We've completely rebuilt Neon Auth using [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) as the foundation. All authentication data now lives directly in your Neon database, making Neon Auth fully branch-compatible so you can test real authentication workflows in isolated environments.

![Neon Auth](/docs/changelog/neon_auth.png)

The new implementation stores users, sessions, and organizations in a dedicated `neon_auth` schema within your database. When you branch your database, your entire auth state branches with it—users, sessions, orgs, configuration, and JWKS are all included. Each branch gets its own isolated auth endpoint.

Key improvements:

- **Auth lives in your database** — Your user model sits inside your Postgres database, evolving through your migrations and integrating naturally with the rest of your schema.
- **Session and JWT handling is automatic** — Session cookies are http-only and managed by Neon Auth, while JWTs integrate seamlessly with the Data API.
- **Works with RLS automatically** — Your Row-Level Security policies can reference the authenticated user directly, without maintaining duplicate identity tables.
- **No webhook syncing** — Unlike our previous implementation, there's no external identity provider or event-based synchronization to manage.

Neon Auth is available on all Neon plans, including Free. Get started with our quickstart guides for [Next.js](/docs/auth/auth-nextjs), [React](/docs/auth/auth-react), or [TanStack](/docs/auth/auth-tanstack).

## More projects on the Free plan

Another week, another increase: The Neon Free plan now includes:

- ~~70 projects~~
- **80 projects**

More projects means more room to experiment, prototype, and build without worrying about limits.

![Dashboard page showing 80 Free Plan projects](/docs/changelog/free_plan_projects_80.png)

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users. No action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).
