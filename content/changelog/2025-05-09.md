## Neon on Azure is now generally available

We're excited to announce that Neon on Azure is now generally available! After a successful beta period, Neon is now fully supported as an Azure Native ISV Service, allowing you to deploy and manage Neon Postgres databases directly from the Azure portal.

The GA release includes several new features and enhancements:

- **Support for additional Azure regions** including Azure Germany West Central (Frankfurt) and Azure West US 3 (Arizona)
- **Azure Service Connector integration** for simplified connectivity between Azure services (like App Service or Azure Functions) and your Neon Postgres database
- **Create and manage branches directly in the Azure portal** for streamlined development workflows
- **Retrieve connection strings from the Azure interface** for easier application setup
- **Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) eligibility** - Neon Postgres purchases made through the Azure Marketplace count toward your committed Azure spend

## Support for PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension

Neon now supports the [PostgreSQL Anonymizer (anon)](/docs/extensions/postgresql-anonymizer) extension, enabling you to mask sensitive data in development and testing environments. **This extension is currently experimental in Neon** and must be explicitly enabled.

The initial support includes **static masking**, which replaces sensitive data with anonymized values. You can also automate data anonymization using Neon branches and GitHub Actions. Learn more in our [Data anonymization](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization) guide.

## Neon MCP Server enhancements

- Added a new [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/mcp-server-neon) tool, `list_branch_computes`, for branch compute management. It supports retrieving information about your computes, including compute ID, type, size, and autoscaling details.
- Implemented `list_slow_queries` tool to identify performance bottlenecks by finding the slowest queries in your database, helping you optimize application performance.
- Added a query performance tuning system with multiple tools:
  - `explain_sql_statement` for analyzing query execution plans
  - `prepare_query_tuning` for suggesting performance optimizations
  - `complete_query_tuning` for applying or discarding optimizations after testing
- Enhanced the `list_projects` tool with better hints and a default limit of 10 projects for more manageable output.

## ✨ New AI-friendly options in Docs

To support workflows that use AI tools, the Neon Docs now include two new options on every page:

- **Copy page as markdown** – copy the full content in markdown format.
- **Open in ChatGPT** – open the page in ChatGPT with a prefilled `READ <url>` instruction.

These options make it easier to bring Neon documentation into your AI-enabled IDE and AI-assisted workflows.

We also provide an LLM-friendly version of our documentation at [https://neon.com/llms.txt](/llms.txt).

## 📺 In case you missed it: 20 Years of Hacking Postgres with Heikki Linnakangas

Neon co-founder and Postgres core contributor Heikki Linnakangas joined Aaron Francis for a wide-ranging conversation on two decades of Postgres development. Heikki shares stories from the early days, the origin of Neon, and what's next for Postgres and serverless databases.

And don't forget to check out this week's fixes and improvements:

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**
  - Improved **Parent branch** badges on child branch pages to better support long branch names. Long names now truncate with an ellipsis and display in full on hover. Previously, long names could overflow the badge area.
  - Removed a duplicate **Monitoring** entry from the Neon Console sidebar. **Monitoring** now appears only under the **Branch** section.
  - Enhanced the Autoscaling slider in compute settings to provide a better user experience when configuring autoscaling ranges. The slider now intelligently adjusts to ensure valid min/max values are always enforced.
  - Redesigned the project settings page to provide a more streamlined experience. All settings are now consolidated on a single page with easy navigation between sections, replacing the previous multi-tab interface.
  - Fixed an issue where organization users were incorrectly shown Early Access program options in their account settings.

- **Neon API**
  - Fixed an issue in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) API where specifying [shared preloaded libraries](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#extensions-with-preloaded-libraries) for Postgres extensions did not apply the requested settings. Projects were created successfully, but the configuration was ignored.

- **Backup & Restore** (available in [Early Access](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings#early-access))
  - Enhanced snapshot functionality on the **Backup & Restore** page in the Neon Console to support archived branches. Previously, creating a snapshot of an archived branch would fail. Now, the branch is automatically unarchived before the snapshot is created.
  - Fixed an issue that caused restore operations from the same snapshot to fail due to duplicate branch names. Previously, attempting to restore multiple times triggered a `Request failed: branch with that name already exists` error.
