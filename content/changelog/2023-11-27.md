### Fixes & improvements

- Compute: Neon has introduced a new pre-installed "neon" extension, which includes functions and views designed to gather Neon-specific metrics. The metrics are intended for use by the Neon team for the purpose of enhancing our service. The views are owned by a Neon system role (`cloud_admin`), but you are able to view them by connecting to the `postgres` database using `psql` and executing the command `\dv neon.*`, as shown below. At present, the extension includes two views for local file cache metrics. We may incorporate additional views in future releases.

  ```bash shouldWrap
  psql 'postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/postgres?sslmode=require'

  postgres=> \dv neon.*
              List of relations
  Schema |      Name      | Type |    Owner
  --------+----------------+------+-------------
  neon   | local_cache    | view | cloud_admin
  neon   | neon_lfc_stats | view | cloud_admin
  (2 rows)
  ```

- Compute: Creating a database with the `neon_superuser` role, altering a database to have owner `neon_superuser`, and altering the `neon_superuser role` itself are no longer permitted. The `neon_superuser` role is a `NOLOGIN` role used by Neon to grant prvileges to PostgreSQL roles created via the Neon Console, CLI, or API, and is not intended to be used directly or modified. For more information about this role, see [The neon_superuser role](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role).
