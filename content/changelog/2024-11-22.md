## A new Python SDK for the Neon API

Neon has a new [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/neon-api/), which is a wrapper for the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). This SDK simplifies integration of Python applications with Neon by providing methods to programmatically manage Neon API keys, projects, branches, databases, endpoints, roles, and operations.

It's easy to install with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install neon-api
```

Then, from Python:

```python
from neon_api import NeonAPI

# Initialize the client.
neon = NeonAPI.from_environ() or NeonAPI(api_key='your_api_key')

# Get the current user
user = neon.me()
print(user)
```

For more, see [Python SDK for the Neon API](/docs/reference/python-sdk).

In addition to the new Python SDK, Neon offers a TypeScript SDK for the Neon API. There are also community-maintained SDKs available for Go and Node.js. [Learn more](/docs/reference/sdk).

## A Migration Assistant to help move your data

When you're ready to move your data to Neon, our new **Migration Assistant** can help. All you need to get started is a connection string for your existing database.

Enter your current database connection string, and the Assistant will:

1. Run some preliminary checks on your database.
1. Create a Neon project that best matches your current environment.
1. Provide `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` commands to transfer your data, pre-populated with the correct connection strings.

For more, see [Neon Migration Assistant](/docs/import/migration-assistant).

## Organization account support for Vercel and GitHub integrations

Our **Vercel Previews** and **GitHub** integrations are now supported on Organization accounts. In case you're not familiar:

- The [Vercel Previews Integration](/docs/guides/vercel-previews-integration) connects your Vercel project to a Neon database and creates a database branch with each Vercel preview deployment.
- The [GitHub Integration](/docs/guides/neon-github-integration) connects your Neon projects to corresponding GitHub repositories, letting you bring your database to your DevOps workflow.

You can now make both integrations available to your Neon organization.

## `timescaledb` extension support for Postgres 17

We added support for the `timescaledb` extension, version 2.17.1, to Postgres 17.

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

And don't forget to check out this week's fixes and improvements:

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **IP Allow**

  We addressed an issue for IP Allow users connecting over VPN where an **Access Denied** modal appeared repeatedly on the **SQL Editor** and **Tables** pages in the Neon Console. To prevent this, we added a "Do not ask again" checkbox to allow users to silence the modal.

- **Neon API updates**

  We added two new endpoints for managing Neon [Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) members:

  - [Update the role for an organization member](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateorganizationmember)
  - [Remove member from the organization](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/removeorganizationmember)

- **Time Travel Assist**

  Ephemeral compute suspend timeouts for [Time Travel Assist](/docs/guides/time-travel-assist) have been increased from 10 to 30 seconds. Time Travel Assist enables querying any point in your history using temporary branches and computes, which are automatically cleaned up after use. After 30 seconds of inactivity, the branch is deleted, and the endpoint is removed.
