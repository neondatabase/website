## ChatGPT + Neon MCP Server

You can now connect ChatGPT to your **Neon MCP Server** using custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors.

This integration makes it easy to extend ChatGPT with Neon’s database capabilities—so you can query, manage, and interact with your Neon projects directly within ChatGPT.

## Community: Neon Testing – Vitest library for integration tests

We’re excited to share **[Neon Testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neon-testing)**, a community-built library by [Mikael Lirbank](https://www.lirbank.com/) that makes it easy to run integration tests against Neon databases.

Instead of relying on mocks or maintaining local test databases, Neon Testing uses Neon’s branching to provision **disposable Postgres test databases** for each test file. This means your tests run against the same schema and constraints as production, catching issues that mocks can miss (like unique constraint failures and transaction rollbacks).

## Neon OTel integration + New Relic

Neon’s [OpenTelemetry (OTEL) integration](/docs/guides/opentelemetry) now has a step-by-step guide for sending your project’s metrics and Postgres logs to [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)—a cloud-based observability platform that helps developers and organizations monitor, debug, and optimize the performance of their applications and infrastructure.

Check out the guide from contributor _Dhanush Reddy_: [Getting started with Neon and New Relic](https://neon.com/guides/newrelic-otel-neon).

## Improved Neon Docs navigation

We've introduced a new horizontal navigation bar in the Neon Docs to make it easier to find what you need. You can now quickly scan across the top-level menus, each with a dropdown of related topics. When you select a menu item, a dedicated left-hand sidebar for that topic area opens, giving you a clear view of everything available within that section.

This update improves discoverability and helps you move through the docs more efficiently.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**
  - We adjusted the warning mesage on the **Edit compute** modal about connection brief disruptions when changing the compute size. The warning message now only appears when compute size values are modified.
  - Fixed an issue where the **Branch expiration** modal would close without notice if an error occurred. The modal now remains open and displays the error message.
- **Backup & restore**
  - On the **Backup & restore** page on the Neon Console, snapshots are now listed with a more user-friendly branch name instead of the branch ID value.
  - The **Restore branch modal** now shows the new branch expiration time that will be set when restoring a branch that is configured to expire.
- **Neon API**
  - The [List projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) endpoint now enforces rate limits: up to **10 requests per second** and a maximum of **300 requests per minute**.
- **Native Vercel integration**
  - On the **Branch overview** page for users of the native Vercel integration, the **Open preview deployment** link now directs to the correct Vercel deployment page instead of the application’s page.
  - You can now open the **Branch overview** page in the Neon Console for a preview deployment branch directly from the Vercel deployment page.
