## ChatGPT + Neon MCP Server

You can now connect ChatGPT to the **Neon MCP Server** using custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors.

This integration makes it easy to extend ChatGPT with Neonâ€™s database capabilitiesâ€”so you can query, manage, and interact with your Neon projects directly within ChatGPT.

## Community: Neon Testing â€“ Vitest library for integration tests

Weâ€™re excited to share **[Neon Testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neon-testing)**, a community-built library by [Mikael Lirbank](https://www.lirbank.com/) that makes it easy to run integration tests against Neon databases.

Instead of relying on mocks or maintaining local test databases, Neon Testing uses Neonâ€™s branching to provision **disposable Postgres test databases** for each test file. This means your tests run against the same schema and constraints as production, catching issues that mocks can miss (like unique constraint failures and transaction rollbacks).

- Install from npm: [neon-testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neon-testing)

## Neon OTel integration + New Relic

Neonâ€™s [OpenTelemetry (OTEL) integration](/docs/guides/opentelemetry) has a new step-by-step guide for sending your Neon projectâ€™s metrics and Postgres logs to [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)â€”a cloud-based observability platform that helps developers and organizations monitor, debug, and optimize the performance of their applications and infrastructure.

Check out the guide from contributor _Dhanush Reddy_: [Getting started with Neon and New Relic](/guides/newrelic-otel-neon).

## Improved Neon Docs navigation

We've introduced a new horizontal navigation bar in the [Neon Docs](/docs/introduction) to make it easier to find what you need. You can now quickly scan across the top-level menus, each with a dropdown of related topics. When you select a menu item, a dedicated left-hand sidebar for that topic area opens, giving you a clear view of everything available within that section.

This update improves discoverability and helps you move through the docs more efficiently.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**
  - We adjusted the warning message on the **Edit compute** modal about connection disruptions when changing the compute size. The warning message now only appears when compute size values are modified.
  - Fixed an issue where the **Branch expiration** modal would close without notice if an error occurred. The modal now remains open and displays the error message.
- **Backup & restore**
  - On the **Backup & restore** page in the Neon Console, snapshots are now listed with a more user-friendly branch name instead of the branch ID value.
  - The **Restore branch modal** now shows the new branch expiration time that will be set when restoring a branch configured to expire.
- **Native Vercel integration**
  - On the **Branch overview** page for users of the native Vercel integration, the **Open preview deployment** link now correctly directs to Vercel deployment page instead of the application page.
  - You can now open the **Branch overview** page in the Neon Console for a preview deployment branch directly from the Vercel deployment page.
