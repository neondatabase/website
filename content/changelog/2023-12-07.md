### Integrations page in Console

The **Integrations** page in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/) provides a hub for managing third-party integrations with your Neon project.

When visiting the **Integrations** page, you'll notice different categories:

- **Available**: These are integrations available for you to add and use immediately.
- **Coming soon**: These are the integrations that will be available in the near future.
- **Request an integration**: An option for you to request new integrations.

We've recently added several integrations to our **Coming soon** category. You can express your interest in a particular integration by clicking **Request** and sharing your use case, which helps us prioritize and build for exactly what you need. Have a look and let us know what integration you would like Neon to build next.
