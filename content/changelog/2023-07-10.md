### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Added keyboard support (**Tab** + **Enter**) for switching between **Explain** and **Analyze** tabs in the **SQL Editor**.
- UI: Fixed calculations in the **Pro Plan Cost Estimation** tool accessible from the **Billing** page on the Neon Free Tier. The issue resulted in incorrect cost estimates.
- UI: Fixed an issue in the **SQL Editor** that caused a page reload when switching between **Explain** and **Analyze** tabs.

### Faster Postgres queries for Vercel Edge Functions

The [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) now supports for SQL queries over HTTP, providing up to a 40% reduction in query latencies from [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions) and [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) for one-shot queries. The enhanced driver brings same-region query response times down to single-digit milliseconds.

Additionally, we worked with the team at Drizzle to add Neon serverless driver support for [Drizzle-ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), an ORM for TypeScript. For an example demonstrating how to use the driver with Drizzle-ORM for type safety, see [How to use the driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver#how-to-use-the-driver).
