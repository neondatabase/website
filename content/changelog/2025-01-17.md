### Neon Copilot Extension

The [Neon Database Copilot Extension](https://github.com/marketplace/neon-database) is now available in the GitHub Marketplace. This extension makes it easier to configure Neon for your repository. You can chat with the latest Neon documentation within the context of your repository!

![GitHub Copilot Extension](/docs/relnotes/github_copilot_extension.png)

Chat with curated Neon database documentation directly in GitHub Copilot and get answers to common questions like:

- _How to create a project?_
- _How can I get started with the Neon API?_
- _How do integrate the Neon API into my GitHub repository._

**Setup instructions:**

1. Install the extension
2. Type `@neondatabase` in the chat to start interacting

Coming soon, you'll be able to directly interact with Neon endpoints by simply asking questions. Additionally, new tools will enable you to create Neon databases directly from the chat interface.

### Schema Diff API

Rounding out our schema diff features, Neon now supports a schema diff API endpoint (`compare_schema`), enabling programmatic comparison of database schemas between Neon branches. This addition complements our existing Schema Diff features available in the Console, CLI, and GitHub Action.

**Example:**

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}/compare_schema?base_branch_id={base_branch_id}&db_name={db_name}' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

For detailed documentation, see [Using the Schema Diff API](/docs/guides/schema-diff#using-the-neon-api).

## Postgres extension updates

- The `pg_mooncake` extension has been updated to version 0.1.0. For details about this release, see the [release page](https://github.com/Mooncake-Labs/pg_mooncake/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

  To use the `pg_mooncake` extension with Neon, check out our [pg_mooncake guide](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg_mooncake) for more information.

  To upgrade from a previous version of the extension, follow the instructions in [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version).

- The `pg_embedding` extension, deprecated in September 2023, has been removed from Neon. This extension supported the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for vector similarity search in Postgres. HNSW support is now available in the [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) extension, which is also supported by Neon.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Console updates**

  - Enhanced pagination controls on the **Branches** page now let you adjust rows per page and skip directly to first/last pages.
  - Billing period dates in the console are now consistently shown in UTC format. Previously, these dates were sometimes shown incorrectly due to timezone conversions.
  - The Datadog integration is now accessible from both the **Integrations** and **Monitoring** pages for all users, with availability based on your plan.
  - The Trust Center is now accessible from the Help Menu **(?)** in the Neon Console. Here you can learn about our security practices and access security documentation.

- **Neon API**

  - The Create project API now defines Postgres 17 as the default version.✨

  - **Increased concurrency limits**. We've increased Neon API operation concurrency limits. Previously, concurrent API operations within a Neon project — such as operations on different branches — could trigger a "project already has running operations" error, where one branch operation would block others. This improvement reduces the need to work around strict concurrency limits. However, we still recommend adding retry functionality to handle rare cases where an API operation fails due to ongoing operations.

    This enhancement is available on Neon's Free, Launch, and Scale plans and will soon roll out to all Neon plans. It applies only to the Neon API. In the Neon Console, controls such as buttons that initiate new operations are still briefly disabled until ongoing operations are complete.

  - We’ve added a new API endpoint to help you retrieve the total number of branches in a project. Use the following request to get the branch count for any project:

    ```bash
    GET /api/v2/projects/{project_id}/branches/count
    ```

    Example response:

    ```bash
    {
       "count": 2
    }
    ```

- **Neon CLI**

  The Neon CLI now creates projects with Postgres 17 by default ✨

- **Fixes**

  - Data sizes are now displayed as **kB**, **MB**, **GB** (instead of KiB, MiB, GiB) across our console, docs, and website.
  - Restored the ability for Enterprise customers to set custom scale-to-zero timeout periods.
  - Replaced incorrect "insufficient permissions" message with a loading indicator when Organization admins open a project's **Delete** page.
  - Prevented duplicate installations of the Neon GitHub integration for organizations and personal accounts.
