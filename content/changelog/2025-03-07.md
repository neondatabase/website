## A new Neon MCP Server command üõ†Ô∏è

We're continuing to build [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/mcp-server-neon) capabilities. This week we added support for a new `get_connection_string` command that returns your database connection string.

If you haven't tried the Neon MCP Server yet, follow one of our guides to get started. Spin up databases instantly, run queries, and perform migrations using natural language in any IDE or AI tool that supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp).

### Track your Neon Projects in Slack üí¨

We've been fine-tuning the Neon Slack App that we first introduced back in January. If you haven't tried it yet, see the [documentation](/docs/manage/slack-app) for setup instructions.

Here are the commands it supports to help you manage and monitor your Neon projects:

- `/neon auth` - Connect Slack to your Neon account
- `/neon projects` - List your Neon projects
- `/neon usage` - Show overall resource usage for your account
- `/neon help` - List all available commands
- `/neon status` - Check the current status of Neon's cloud service
- `/neon feedback` - Share your thoughts and suggestions about the Neon Slack App
- `/neon projects usage` - Show resource usage for a specific project
- `/neon projects shared` - List all projects shared with you
- `/neon invite user` - Invite users to your organization

We‚Äôd love to hear your feedback. Use the `/neon feedback` command in Slack to share your thoughts.

## Get started faster with new Neon projects ‚ö°

We've added a **Getting started** widget to the **Project Dashboard** to help you set up new Neon projects faster. You'll see this widget whenever you create a new Neon project. It provides quick access to getting started actions and instructions:

- **Connect to your database** ‚Äì Easily find your database connection details.
- **Import your data** ‚Äì Bring your data to Neon with a few clicks.
- **Get sample data** ‚Äì Load sample datasets to experiment with Neon.
- **View database contents** ‚Äì Manage tables and data directly from the dashboard.

## Neon‚Äôs bug bounty program is now public üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Neon‚Äôs [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/neon_bbp) on HackerOne is now open to the public! After a successful private launch, we‚Äôre now inviting security researchers to test our platform, identify vulnerabilities, and earn rewards.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  We've repositioned the "new query" button in the Neon SQL Editor, bringing it a little closer to the action. You'll now find it at the top of the editor.

- **Postgres extension update**

  The PostgreSQL Anonymizer (`anon`) extension, which was not officially supported in Neon but enabled for some users for evaluation, will be removed. Data anonymization support continues to be on our 2025 roadmap. We will contact known `anon` extension users directly by email before we remove the extension. If you are using the `anon` extension and have questions or concerns, please reach out to [Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.17. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Neon GitHub Actions update**

  The [Neon Create Branch Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/neon-create-branch-github-action) was refactored to use the GitHub [typescript-action template](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action), and the version was updated to `v6`. The new version includes new and modified field names.
