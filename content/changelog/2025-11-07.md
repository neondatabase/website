title: Vercel integration gets current plans, reduced compute pricing
---

## Reduced compute pricing across Launch, Scale, and Agent plans

We've reduced compute pricing by up to 25% across our plans:

- **Launch plan**: Now $0.106 per CU-hour (previously $0.14)
- **Scale plan**: Now $0.222 per CU-hour (previously $0.26)
- **Agent plan**: Now $0.106 per CU-hour (previously $0.14)

These price reductions apply immediately to all usage going forward. No action is required—you'll automatically benefit from the new lower rates on your next billing cycle.

For detailed pricing information and usage examples, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans). To learn more about this price reduction, see our [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/major-compute-price-reduction-on-neon).

## Vercel integration now supports current Neon pricing plans

Vercel integration users now have full access to Neon's current usage-based pricing plans (Free, Launch, and Scale). Previously, Vercel integration users were limited to Neon's legacy plans. Free plan Vercel users have been automatically migrated to the new Neon Free plan. This change gives you access to all the latest features and pricing options, including:

- Usage-based pricing with $5/month minimum on paid plans
- Enhanced compute options and autoscaling
- Advanced features like database branching for preview deployments
- Flexible project and branch limits

To upgrade your plan, visit the **Storage** tab in your Vercel Dashboard, select your database, and navigate to **Settings** > **Change Configuration**.

For more information, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Connect your app to Neon with a single command

We've introduced a new command that configures the Neon MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server, giving your AI assistant full context about your Neon project—including connection details, schema, and best practices—so. Run this command in your app's root directory:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init
```

The command walks you through an interactive setup:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init

After setup, restart Cursor and ask your AI assistant to "Get started with Neon using MCP Resource" to interact with your databases, branches, and projects.

This feature is currently in beta for Cursor, with VS Code and Claude Code support coming soon. For more details, see our [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/one-command-to-bridge-cursor-and-neon).

## More projects on the Free plan

We're pleased to announce that the Neon Free plan now includes:

- ~~20 projects~~
- **30 projects**

This means more room for side projects, prototypes, experiments, and learning new stacks.

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users—no action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).
