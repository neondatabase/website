title: Reduced compute pricing, more projects on Free plan, AI-powered onboarding
---

## Reduced compute pricing across Launch, Scale, and Agent plans

We've reduced compute pricing by up to 25% across our plans:

- **Launch plan**: Now $0.106 per CU-hour (previously $0.14)
- **Scale plan**: Now $0.222 per CU-hour (previously $0.26)
- **Agent plan**: Now $0.106 per CU-hour (previously $0.14)

These price reductions apply immediately to all usage going forward. No action is required—you'll automatically benefit from the new lower rates on your next billing cycle.

For detailed pricing information and usage examples, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans). To learn more about these price reductions, see our [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/major-compute-price-reduction-on-neon).

## More projects on the Free plan

We're pleased to announce that the Neon Free plan now includes:

- ~~20 projects~~
- **30 projects**

This means more room for side projects, prototypes, experiments, and learning new stacks.

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users—no action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Connect your app to Neon with a single command

We've introduced a new command that configures the Neon MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server, giving your AI assistant full context about your Neon project—including connection details, schema, and best practices. Run this command in your app's root directory:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init
```

The command walks you through an interactive setup:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init

```

After setup, restart Cursor and ask your AI assistant to "Get started with Neon using MCP Resource" to launch an interactive 7-step onboarding guide. The guide analyzes your codebase and walks you through selecting or creating a project, configuring connection strings, installing dependencies (`@neondatabase/serverless` or `pg`), setting up an ORM like Prisma or Drizzle, and creating your database schema—all with contextual recommendations tailored to your environment.

This feature is currently in beta for Cursor, with VS Code and Claude Code support coming soon. For more details, see our [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/one-command-to-bridge-cursor-and-neon).

## Backup schedule API (Beta)

You can now manage automated backup schedules via the Neon API. Previously, backup schedules could only be configured through the Console. With the new API endpoints, you can programmatically view and update backup schedules for your branches, enabling infrastructure-as-code workflows and automated backup management.

**Available endpoints:**

- `GET /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}/backup_schedule` — View the current backup schedule for a branch
- `PUT /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}/backup_schedule` — Update the backup schedule configuration

This makes it easier to standardize backup policies across projects and integrate backup scheduling into your deployment pipelines.

For more information, see [Backup & restore](/docs/guides/backup-restore#create-backup-schedules).

## Vercel integration now supports current Neon pricing plans

Vercel integration users now have full access to Neon's current usage-based pricing plans (Free, Launch, and Scale). Previously, Vercel integration users were limited to Neon's legacy plans. Free plan Vercel users have been automatically migrated to the new Neon Free plan. This change gives you access to all the latest features and pricing options, including:

- Usage-based pricing with $5/month minimum on paid plans
- Enhanced compute options and autoscaling
- Advanced features like database branching for preview deployments
- Flexible project and branch limits

To upgrade your plan, visit the **Storage** tab in your Vercel Dashboard, select your database, navigate to **Settings** > **Update Configuration**, click the **integration settings** link, and click **Change Plan**.

For more information, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Backup & restore**
  - Fixed an issue where the source branch selector was empty on non-root branches, preventing point-in-time restore and preview data from working
  - Fixed snapshot list sorting on the Backup & Restore page: snapshots within each time group (Today, This week, This month) now show most recent first
  - Added a "Configure" link on the Backup & Restore page that takes you directly to the Storage settings page where you can adjust your PITR retention window
  - Changed default retention period for daily backup schedules from 1 to 14 days
- **Data API**
  - The `authenticated` and `anonymous` roles created by the Data API are now granted to `neondb_owner`, allowing you to test RLS policies by switching roles (e.g., `SET ROLE authenticated`)
- **Vercel native integration**
  - Added automatic cleanup of deployment records on the Deployments tab in Vercel when branches are deleted
