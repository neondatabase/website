title: Vercel integration gets current plans, reduced compute pricing

## Vercel integration now supports current Neon pricing plans

Vercel integration users now have full access to Neon's current usage-based pricing plans (Free, Launch, and Scale). Previously, Vercel integration users were limited to legacy plans. Free plan Vercel users have been automatically migrated to the new Neon Free plan. This change gives you access to all the latest features and pricing options, including:

- Usage-based pricing with $5/month minimum on paid plans
- Enhanced compute options and autoscaling
- Advanced features like database branching for preview deployments
- Flexible project and branch limits

To upgrade your plan, visit the **Storage** tab in your Vercel Dashboard, select your database, and navigate to **Settings** > **Change Configuration**.

For more information, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Reduced compute pricing across Launch, Scale, and Agent plans

We've reduced compute pricing across our plans:

- **Launch plan**: Now $0.106 per CU-hour (previously $0.14)
- **Scale plan**: Now $0.222 per CU-hour (previously $0.26)
- **Agent plan**: Now $0.106 per CU-hour (previously $0.14)

These price reductions apply immediately to all usage going forward. No action is required—you'll automatically benefit from the new lower rates on your next billing cycle.

For detailed pricing information and usage examples, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans). To learn more about this price reduction, see our [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/major-compute-price-reduction-on-neon).

## Connect your app to Neon with a single command

We've introduced a new `npx neonctl init` command to help you quickly connect your app and enable the Neon integration in your Cursor chat. Run the following command in your app's root directory:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init
```

The command walks you through an interactive setup:

```
🚀 Neon Project Initialization
Step 1/3: Configuring Neon MCP Server...
Step 2/3: Creating neon.md with detailed guidelines...
Step 3/3: Creating AGENTS.md for Cursor...
✓ Success! Neon project initialized.
```

After setup, you can ask your Cursor chat to "Get started with Neon" and it will have full context about your project and Neon best practices.

This feature is currently in beta for Cursor, with VS Code and Claude Code support coming soon.

## HIPAA support now available for Postgres 18

HIPAA compliance is now supported for Postgres 18 projects. You can create Postgres 18 projects in HIPAA-enabled Neon organizations and enable HIPAA compliance on existing Postgres 18 projects.

For more information about HIPAA compliance on Neon, see [HIPAA compliance](/docs/security/hipaa).

## More projects on the Free plan

We're pleased to announce that the Neon Free plan now includes:

- ~~20 projects~~
- **30 projects**

This means more room for side projects, prototypes, experiments, and learning new stacks. Over the coming weeks, we'll continue increasing this limit until it reaches 100 projects.

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users—no action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).
