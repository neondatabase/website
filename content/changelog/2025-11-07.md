title: Reduced compute pricing, data masking beta, AI-powered onboarding
---

## Reduced compute pricing across Launch, Scale, and Agent plans

We've reduced compute pricing by up to 25% across our plans:

- **Launch plan**: Now $0.106 per CU-hour (previously $0.14)
- **Scale plan**: Now $0.222 per CU-hour (previously $0.26)
- **Agent plan**: Now $0.106 per CU-hour (previously $0.14)

These price reductions apply immediately to all usage going forward. No action is required—you'll automatically benefit from the new lower rates on your next billing cycle.

For detailed pricing information and usage examples, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans). To learn more about these price reductions, see our [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/major-compute-price-reduction-on-neon).

## Data masking (Beta)

Neon now offers a data masking feature that makes it easy to create anonymized branches for development and testing. Define masking rules through the Neon Console or API to protect sensitive data like email addresses, names, phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information. Apply these rules to create a branch with production-like data that's safe to share with your team.

This feature uses the PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension (`anon`) under the hood.

For more information, see [Data anonymization](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization).

## Connect your app to Neon with a single command

We've introduced a new command that configures the Neon MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server, giving your AI assistant full context about your Neon project—including connection details, schema, and best practices. Run this command in your app's root directory:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init
```

The command walks you through an interactive setup:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init

```

After setup, restart Cursor and ask your AI assistant to "Get started with Neon using MCP Resource" to launch an interactive 7-step onboarding guide. The guide analyzes your codebase and walks you through selecting or creating a project, configuring connection strings, installing dependencies (`@neondatabase/serverless` or `pg`), setting up an ORM like Prisma or Drizzle, and creating your database schema—all with contextual recommendations tailored to your environment.

This feature is currently in beta for Cursor, with VS Code and Claude Code support coming soon. For more details, see our [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/one-command-to-bridge-cursor-and-neon).

## More projects on the Free plan

We're pleased to announce that the Neon Free plan now includes:

- ~~20 projects~~
- **30 projects**

This means more room for side projects, prototypes, experiments, and learning new stacks.

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users—no action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Backup schedule API (Beta)

You can now manage automated snapshot schedules via the Neon API. Previously, backup schedules could only be configured through the Console. With the new API endpoints, you can programmatically view and update backup schedules for your branches, enabling infrastructure-as-code workflows and automated backup management.

**Available endpoints:**

- `GET /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}/backup_schedule` — View the current backup schedule for a branch
- `PUT /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}/backup_schedule` — Update the backup schedule configuration

This makes it easier to standardize backup policies across projects and integrate snapshot scheduling into your deployment pipelines.

For more information, see [Backup & restore](/docs/guides/backup-restore).

## Vercel integration now supports current Neon pricing plans

Vercel integration users now have full access to Neon's current usage-based pricing plans (Free, Launch, and Scale). Previously, Vercel integration users were limited to Neon's legacy plans. Free plan Vercel users have been automatically migrated to the new Neon Free plan. This change gives you access to all the latest features and pricing options, including:

- Usage-based pricing with $5/month minimum on paid plans
- Enhanced compute options and autoscaling
- Advanced features like database branching for preview deployments
- Flexible project and branch limits

To upgrade your plan, visit the **Storage** tab in your Vercel Dashboard, select your database, and navigate to **Settings** > **Change Configuration**.

For more information, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).
