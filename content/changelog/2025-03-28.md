title: Neon serverless driver GA, easier Neon Auth setup, MCP Server updates, and more
---

## Neon serverless driver is now generally available (GA)

The [Neon serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) for JavaScript/TypeScript has reached **version 1.0.0** and is now generally available! Built for environments like Vercel Functions, Cloudflare Workers, and even browsers, the driver carries SQL over HTTP or WebSockets â€” no raw TCP required.

This GA release brings a cleaner, more maintainable codebase, stronger SQL injection safeguards, support for composable tagged-template queries, and better performance when inserting binary data over HTTP.

**What you need to know about the 1.0.0 GA release:**

- It requires **Node.js v19 or later**.
- It includes a **breaking change** but only if you're calling the HTTP query template function as a conventional function. The first usage shown below remains safe and supported. However, the second usage is an SQL injection risk (notice the parentheses) and is no longer permitted and now throws an error. You'll need to update your app if you use it.

  ```javascript
  // this usage remains safe and supported
  const resultA = await sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}`;
  // this usage is not safe and now throws an error
  const resultB = await sql(`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}`);
  ```

For more about these changes and others in the 1.0.0 GA release, please see the [1.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/pull/149) or read the [blog post](/blog/serverless-driver-ga).

## Streamlined Neon Auth setup

With Neon Auth, your user data is available right in your database.

We've simplified Neon Auth onboarding so you can add authentication to your project faster. With a cleaner UI and clearer steps, it's now easier to get started adding your first users with Neon Auth.

## MCP Server updates

We're continuing to improve our MCP Server. This week, we added built-in support for the [AI rules](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/ai-rules) we announced two weeks ago. In case you missed it, we provide AI rules for setting up Neon Auth, querying your database with the Neon serverless driver, and integrating Neon with Drizzle ORM. Keep an eye out for more AI rules as we expand this resource.

Windows developers will also find improved platform compatibility in this release. See the [MCP Server changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/mcp-server-neon/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to find the latest updates.

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Getting started panel**

  Added a new **Integrate Neon with your AI tools** option to the Project Dashboard, making it easier to connect Neon with AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Zep, Qdrant, and Weaviate.

- **Neon API**

  - Added `started_at` timestamp field to the Endpoint response object. This field indicates when a compute endpoint was last started, providing better visibility into compute lifecycle events.
  - Updated the [Delete VPC endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteorganizationvpcendpoint) API to clarify that deleted VPC endpoints cannot be re-added to the same Neon organization.

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.19. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
