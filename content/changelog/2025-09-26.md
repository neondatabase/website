While in preview, there are a few [limitations to keep in mind](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy#postgres-18-support).

To learn more about the new features and improvements in Postgres 18:

- Read our blog post: [Postgres 18 Is Out: Try it on Neon](https://neon.com/blog/postgres-18)
- Review the official [Postgres 18 release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/release-18.html)

## Monitor Postgres network traffic with Elephantshark

We’ve released **Elephantshark**, an open-source Ruby script from Neon for monitoring Postgres network traffic.

Elephantshark sits between Postgres clients and servers, decrypting and re-encrypting SSL/TLS traffic while logging protocol messages. It works with all Postgres-protocol traffic, not just Neon databases. It can also generate `SSLKEYLOGFILE` entries for Wireshark.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Backup & restore**
  - The **Create snapshot** button on the **Backup & restore** page (available in [Early Access](/docs/introduction/early-access)) in the Neon Console is now disabled when the snapshot limit is reached (1 on the Free plan and 10 on paid plans). For more about snapshots, see [Backup & restore](/docs/guides/backup-restore).
- **Per-project usage alerts on the Free plan**
  - Usage alerts have been updated on the Free plan for storage, data transfer, and compute usage. Alerts are per-project and sent out at 80% and 100% usage thresholds. For an overview of Free plan usage allowances, please see our [Pricing page](https://neon.com/pricing).
- **SQL Editor**
  - You can now scroll through results when running queries with multiple statements. Each statement’s results appear in their own tab, and a scrollbar makes it easier to navigate when many tabs are returned.
- **Postgres extensions**
  - The `neon` Postgres extension, which provides functions and views for gathering Neon-specific metrics, has been updated to version 1.7. To learn more about the extension, see [The neon extension](/docs/extensions/neon).
