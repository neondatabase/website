## Support for Postgres 18 (Preview)

We're excited to announce that Neon now supports Postgres 18 in preview. To start using Postgres 18, create a new Neon project and select **18** as the **Postgres version**. For detailed instructions, refer to our [Create a project guide](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

You can also review the key changes in Postgres 18 in the [Postgres Release 18 documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/release-18.html).

## 🦈 Monitor Postgres network traffic with Elephantshark

We’ve released **Elephantshark**, an open-source Ruby script from Neon for monitoring Postgres network traffic.

Elephantshark sits between Postgres clients and servers, decrypting and re-encrypting SSL/TLS traffic while logging protocol messages. It works with all Postgres-protocol traffic—not just Neon databases—and can even generate `SSLKEYLOGFILE` entries for Wireshark.
