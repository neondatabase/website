### We are sunsetting pg_embedding in favor of pgvector

Neon's `pg_embedding` extension was the first to introduce the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index to Postgres, but with the recent addition of HNSW to `pgvector`, we see little benefit to the Postgres community in continuing to develop a separate vector search extension.

After careful consideration, we believe it is in the best interest of our users and the broader Postgres community to sunset `pg_embedding` and continue our effort in the vector search space by contributing to `pgvector`.

As a result, we will no longer be committing to `pg_embedding` and will direct our efforts toward `pgvector` instead.

For anyone currently using `pg_embedding`, you will be able to continue using it on Neon. However, we strongly encourage you to migrate to `pgvector`.

For more about our decision to sunset `pg_embedding` and what comes next for Neon in the vector search space, please refer to our blog post: [Weâ€™re sunsetting pg_embedding in favor of pgvector](/blog/sunset-pgembedding).

### Fixes & improvements

- Compute: With the announcement regarding sunsetting of `pg_embedding`, Neon no longer permits new installations of the `pg_embedding` extension.
- Proxy: The timing of connection retries from the Neon proxy was adjusted to reduce connection wait times. The previous retry timing configuration could have resulted in making clients wait hundreds of milliseconds longer than necessary.
