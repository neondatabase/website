title: Usage-based pricing, branch expiration, Neon Local enhancements, and more

## New usage-based pricing plans

We’ve introduced **usage-based pricing** for Neon paid plans — starting at just **$5/month**. Pay only for what you use. This plan update also includes **more storage on the Free plan**. For details, see the [pricing page](https://neon.com/pricing) and read the [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/new-usage-based-pricing).

## Branch expiration now available to all users

Branch expiration is now available to all Neon users! Previously available only to Early Access users, you can now set an expiry date to automatically delete branches at a specified time, helping keep projects clean and reduce storage costs for temporary branches.

Set an expiration time when creating or updating branches via the API, CLI, GitHub Actions, or Neon Console, up to 30 days ahead of time. When that time comes, the branch and its compute endpoints are permanently deleted.

To learn more, see our [Branch expiration](/docs/guides/branch-expiration) guide.

## Enhanced Neon Local development experience

**Neon Local**, a service that lets you work with your Neon cloud database locally from Docker, now supports connecting your app to any existing branch in your Neon project. Previously, Neon Local only supported creating ephemeral branches that were automatically deleted when the container stopped.

Additionally, **Neon Local Connect**, the VS Code extension for Neon Local (also supported in Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code-compatible editors), now includes:

- **Database Schema view** – Browse databases, schemas, tables, columns, and relationships right from your IDE. Quickly inspect structures, explore relationships, and perform table actions like querying, truncating, or dropping—all without leaving your editor.
- **Built-in SQL Editor** – Run queries directly in your IDE, view and filter results in a table, export data, and see execution stats. Perfect for testing changes or debugging without switching to an external SQL client.

These updates make it easier to explore your database, run queries, and manage schema changes without leaving your development environment.

To learn more, see [Neon Local](/docs/local/neon-local).

## Generate apps locally with open-source models

**App.build**, Neon's open-source reference implementation for agent builders, now supports running **open-weight LLMs** via **Ollama**, **LMStudio**, and **OpenRouter**, letting you build apps without cloud API dependency or associated costs. You can also access large open-weight models through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

```bash
LLM_BEST_CODING_MODEL=openrouter:qwen/qwen3-coder LLM_UNIVERSAL_MODEL=openrouter:z-ai/glm-4.5-air uv run generate "Create another to-do app, but give it a Roman Empire style—because I can’t stop thinking about it."
```

## New Postgres extension: online_advisor

We've added support for a new Postgres extension. Developed by our very own [Konstantin Knizhnik](https://github.com/knizhnik), the `online_advisor` extension provides actionable tips for faster queries, based on your real workload:

- Recommend indexes for heavy filtering
- Suggest extended statistics when estimates are off
- Flag queries that should use prepared statements

For more about this new extension, refer to the [online_advisor](/docs/extensions/online_advisor) guide.

## New NAT gateway IP addresses

We've added new NAT gateway IP addresses in the AWS Europe (Frankfurt) region to expand infrastructure capacity. If you have external IP allowlists that enable connections from external services into Neon, **update those allowlists soon to include the new addresses** to avoid connectivity issues.

### New IP addresses

**AWS Europe (Frankfurt) – `aws-eu-central-1`**

- 3.66.63.165
- 18.194.181.241
- 52.58.17.95

See our [Regions documentation](/docs/introduction/regions#aws-nat-gateway-ip-addresses) for the full list of NAT gateway IPs.

## Upcoming status page migration

Please be aware that we’ll soon be migrating [neonstatus.com](https://neonstatus.com/) to a new provider. The migration is planned for completion by the end of next week. More details about the migration will be provided in next week’s changelog.

## Neon + Better Stack integration guide

Neon’s [OpenTelemetry (OTEL) integration](/docs/guides/opentelemetry) now has a step-by-step guide for sending your project’s metrics and Postgres logs to [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/)—an observability platform for unified logging, monitoring, and alerting.

Check out the guide from contributor _Dhanush Reddy_: [Getting started with Neon and Better Stack](https://neon.com/guides/betterstack-otel-neon).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.2.6. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

- **Fixes**
  - Previously, the `LOGIN` attribute was always included for `ALTER ROLE` and `CREATE ROLE` statements, even when explicitly specifying `NOLOGIN`. Now, if `NOLOGIN` is provided, `LOGIN` is not appended by default.
  - Fixed an issue with `pg_repack` extension permissions to ensure that non-superusers can create the extension.
