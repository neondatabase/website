## Neon Local for local Postgres development with Docker

Announcing **Neon Local**, a new proxy service that lets you spin up and tear down isolated, production-like Postgres branches right from your local machine or CI, using Docker.

- Automatically creates a new branch when your container starts and cleans it up when you're done
- Works with any Postgres client, including the Neon serverless driver
- Handles routing and authentication to your cloud database without manual configuration

## Beta: Import Data Assistant now **automates** your database migration to Neon

We're also excited to anncounce **beta support** for our new **automated** Import Data Assistant — a faster, simpler way to move your existing Postgres database to Neon. Just provide your connection string, and the assistant will handle the import for you, creating a new branch with your data.

- Supports Postgres databases up to 10GB
- Checks compatibility and guides you through the process

_The Import Data Assistant guides you through the process of moving your data to Neon._

This feature is in beta and has some limitations (see [docs](/docs/import/import-data-assistant) for details). We're working to expand support for larger databases and more providers. If you try it, please let us know how it works for you — your feedback will help shape the future of Neon's import experience.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**
  - Fixed an issue where the connection string for a read replica could sometimes display the main (read-write) replica's connection string in the Connect modal. The correct connection string is now always shown.
  - Fixed an issue where the Console could display a read replica as the primary compute (or vice versa) in the Computes list on the Branch details page. This made it unclear which instance you were managing or observing. The correct compute is now always shown under the correct label.
  - Moved the branch selector to the sidebar for easier access. This and other recent changes are part of laying the groundwork for a more streamlined Console navigation experience coming soon – stay tuned!
