### Replicating data from Neon for Change Data Capture (CDC) setups is now GA

![Neon logical replication banner](/docs/relnotes/neon-logical-replication.jpg)

Neon is pleased to announce **GA support** for replicating data from Neon to other data services and platforms for Change Data Capture (CDC). Define Neon as a publisher to stream data from your Neon database to a variety of external destinations, including data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases. This feature is open to all Neon users. To get started, jump into one of our [step-by-step logical replication guides](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/integrations#replicate-data-from-neon).

### Replicating data to Neon is now available in Beta

Migrate data to Neon from other Postgres providers by defining Neon as a logical replication subscriber. This feature supports near-zero downtime data migrations, continuous replication setups, and migrating data between Neon projects. Refer to our [logical replication migration guides](/docs/guides/integrations#replicate-data-to-neon) to get started.

As with all of our Beta features, improvements are ongoing. If you have any feedback, we'd love to hear it. Let us know via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or our [feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042) on Discord.

### Console enhancements

We've made several enhancements to the Neon Console to improve your experience and streamline your interaction with our user interface.

- You can now access Neon projects shared with you from the project breadcrumb selector in the Neon Console.
    ![Project breadcrumb selector](/docs/relnotes/breadcrumb_project_selector.png 'no-border')
- We added a **Created by** column to the **Branches** page in the Neon Console to display the branch creation source. For example, this new column shows if a branch was created in the console or by the Neon Vercel Integration. Additionally, for branches created by the Neon Vercel Integration, a pop-up is displayed when you hover, with your GitHub account name, a Vercel Preview link, and a link to the pull request associated with the preview branch.

- The **Billing** page for Free Plan users now shows a percentage value for branch compute usage.
  ![Compute branches metric](/docs/relnotes/compute_branches.png 'no-border')
- We've added a new example to the Neon Console Quickstart showing how to connect to to your Neon database from NestJS. You can access the Quickstart from your Project Dashboard by selecting **Show quickstart**.

- The **Primary compute** column on the Branches page now shows your configured autoscaling range, replacing the `Autoscales` badge that was shown previously.

- We now support self-serve account deletion should you need to remove your Neon account for any reason. See [Delete your account](/docs/manage/accounts#delete-your-account) for details.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- Fixed an issue that prevented database and role names from being fully displayed in the **Settings** &#8594; **Default database and role** section on the Vercel integration drawer, accessed from the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console.
- Queries saved to the Neon SQL Editor **Saved** list are now limited to 9 KB in length. A similar restriction was introduced Neon SQL Editor **History** list last week. While you can execute longer queries from the SQL Editor, any query exceeding 9 KB will be truncated when saved. A `-- QUERY TRUNCATED` comment is added at the beginning of these queries to indicate truncation.
- We updated the Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console. This update addresses an issue where updating a column value in one row via the table editor updated the same column value in in other rows.
- Fixed an issue in the Neon Console where some page labels in the sidebar were not highlighted when selected.
- Fixed an issue that caused a `Something went wrong error` to appear briefly after deleting a project from the **Settings** page in the Neon Console.
- Removed information about the Free Plan that was displayed when creating a first project on paid plans.
- Fixed an issue on the Projects page where a deleted project was only removed from the projects list after a page refresh.
- Fixed an issue with the **Time Travel Assist** feature on the **Restore** page in the Neon Console. Attempting to run a time travel query resulted in a `Something went wrong` error being displayed in the console.
- Fixed an a Neon CLI issue that caused the `neon create-app` to fail when providing an app name with the command.
