## Claude Code MCP integration guide

You can now manage your Neon database directly from Claude Code using natural language, made possible by the [Neon Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings the power of Claude AI to your command line. With the new MCP integration, you can interact with your Neon databases using conversational English directly from your terminal - create branches, run migrations, execute queries, and more.

The guide covers both remote (OAuth) and local setup options, making it easy to get started regardless of your preferred authentication method.
