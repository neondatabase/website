### Fixes & improvements

- Compute: Added support for the Postgres `xml2` and `pgjwt` extensions. For more information about Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).
- Compute: Updated the versions for the following Postgres extensions:
  - Updated the `address_standardizer`, `address_standardizer_data_us`, `postgis`, `postgis_raster`, `postgis_tiger_geocoder`, `postgis_topology` extensions to version `3.3.2`.
  - Updated the `plv8`, `plls`, `plcoffee` extensions to `3.1.5`.
  - Updated the `h3_pg` extension to `4.1.2`.

  Updating an extension version requires running an `ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> UPDATE TO <new_version>` statement. For example, to update the `postgis_topology` extension to the newly supported version, run this statement:

  ```sql
  ALTER EXTENSION postgis_topology UPDATE TO '3.3.2';
  ```

- Pageserver: Corrected the storage size metrics calculation to ensure that only active branches are counted.
- Proxy: Enabled `OpenTelemetry` tracing to capture all incoming requests. This change enables Neon to perform an end-to-end trace when a new
  connection is established.
