title: Neon Agent Plan, MCP Server enhancements, Data API improvements, and more
---

## Introducing the Neon Agent Plan

We're happy to announce our new **Agent Plan** for AI agent platforms that need to provision thousands of databases.

The Agent Plan provides custom project and branch limits, higher API rate limits for instant provisioning, and credits for your free tier users. It's designed for platforms like Replit, v0, and Databutton that create databases on behalf of their users. Key features include automatic scale-to-zero, instant restores, and Neon Auth and Data API at no extra cost. [Learn more](https://neon.com/use-cases/ai-agents).

## Data API â€” more improvements

We've added a **Refresh schema cache** button to the Data API page, making it easier to update your REST endpoints when you modify your database schema. We've also continued our performance enhancements, including eliminating API cold starts, as we prepare the Data API for GA. Learn more about the Data API in the [docs](/docs/data-api/get-started).

## Neon MCP Server now with reset_from_parent tool

We've added a new `reset_from_parent` tool to the Neon MCP Server that allows resetting a branch back to its parent branch state. This simplifies branch management when LLMs change schemas or when creating fresh development branches. Learn more in the [MCP Server docs](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server).

## New VPC endpoint service for Private Networking

We've added a new VPC endpoint service address for Private Networking in the AWS Europe (Frankfurt) region. If you're setting up Private Networking in the `eu-central-1` region, you can now use the additional endpoint service address for enhanced infrastructure capacity and reliability.

For the complete list of VPC endpoint service addresses by region, see our [Private Networking guide](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking).

- **Neon Console**
  - Added restart compute functionality to compute management menus, letting you restart compute instances directly from the Console without using CLI or API

  - Added a **Compute last active at** column to your organization's **Projects** table, helping you identify unused projects for cleanup and cost optimization

  - Fixed password encoding in **Parameters only** connection strings, ensuring special characters display correctly for environment variable usage.

  - Added URL encoding for projects list page search and pagination, making it easier to share specific views with team members. For example:

    ```bash shouldWrap
    console.neon.tech/app/org-example/projects?cursor=example-branch-123&q=myapp
    ```
