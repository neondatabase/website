### Fixes & improvements

- Released a new version of the [Neon serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) (v0.2.6), which allows you to query data from [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions), and other environments that support WebSockets. The updated driver offers:
  - Automatic import of the `ws` (WebSocket library) package if required, which makes the driver easier to use on StackBlitz and with Zapatos, for example.
  - More helpful error messages when connection details are not provided. For example, a more informative error message is reported if you forget to set an environment variable for the database connection or forget to include a password in your database connection string.
- Added three new example application repositories to help you get started with the Neon serverless driver on Vercel Edge Functions. The example application generates a `JSON` listing of the 10 nearest UNESCO World Heritage sites using IP geolocation (data copyright © 1992 – 2022 UNESCO/World Heritage Centre).

  - The [neondatabase/neon-vercel-rawsql](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-vercel-rawsql) example demonstrates using raw SQL with Neon's serverless driver on Vercel Edge Functions.
  - The [neondatabase/neon-vercel-zapatos](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-vercel-zapatos) example demonstrates using [Zapatos](https://jawj.github.io/zapatos/) with Neon's serverless driver on Vercel Edge Functions. Zapatos offers zero-abstraction Postgres for TypeScript.
  - The [neondatabase/neon-vercel-kysely](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-vercel-kysely) example demonstrates using [kysely](https://github.com/koskimas/kysely) and [kysely-codegen](https://github.com/RobinBlomberg/kysely-codegen) with Neon's serverless driver on Vercel Edge Functions. Kysely is a type-safe and autocompletion-friendly typescript SQL query builder. `kysely-codegen` generates Kysely type definitions from your database.

  The `UNESCO World Heritage sites` example is also available for the Neon serverless driver on Cloudflare Workers. See [neondatabase/serverless-cfworker-demo](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless-cfworker-demo).
