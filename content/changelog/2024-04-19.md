### Neon is Now Generally Available

April 15th, 2024 was a landmark day for us at Neon as we announced our move to General Availability.

Read more about how Neon is transforming database development, supporting business-critical workloads, and innovating in database scaling and branching in the announcement from our CEO, **Nikita Shamgunov**.

### Monitoring Dashboard

Available from the Neon Console, the **Monitoring** dashboard provides several graphs to help you monitor both system and database metrics, updated in real time based on your usage data. You can access the **Monitoring** dashboard from the sidebar in the Neon Console. Metrics include:

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: 1, paddingRight: '20px' }}>
    <ul>
      <li>RAM</li>
      <li>CPU</li>
      <li>Database size</li>
      <li>Rows</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <ul>
      <li>Connections count</li>
      <li>Buffer cache hit rate</li>
      <li>Deadlocks</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-70px' }} id="schema-diff"></div>

### Schema Diff

We've added a Schema Diff tool that lets you precisely compare database schemas between different branches for better debugging, code review, and team collaboration.

Available from the **Branches** detail page as well as part of Time Travel Assist from the **Restore** page, you can use Schema Diff to compare a branch's schema to its parent or compare any two branches during a branch restore operation.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-70px' }} id="time-travel-from-the-sql-editor"></div>
### Time Travel from the SQL Editor

To help with data recovery workflows, we've made our Time Travel feature available in the **SQL Editor** in the Neon Console. Time Travel Assist is also available now on the **Restore** page, but it's a great feature and we wanted to make it more convenient for you to use, wherever you might need it in the console.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-70px' }} id="support-for-psql-meta-commands-in-sql-editor"></div>

### Support for psql meta-commands in SQL Editor

We added support for `psql` meta-commands to the SQL Editor in the Neon Console. Meta-commands can significantly speed up your workflow by providing quick access to database schemas and other critical information without needing to write full SQL queries. They are especially useful for database management tasks, making it easier to handle administrative duties directly from the Neon Console.

Here are some of the meta-commands that you can use within the Neon SQL Editor:

- `\dt` — List all tables in the current database.
- `\d [table_name]` — Describe a table's structure.
- `\l` — List all databases.
- `\?` - A cheat sheet of available meta-commands
- `\h [NAME]` - Get help for any Postgres command. For example, try `\h SELECT`.

Note that not all meta-commands are supported in the SQL Editor. To get a list of supported commands, use `\?`.

### Protected branches

Users of the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan can now designate a branch as "protected". This status restricts branch access based on IP addresses &#8212; only IPs on your project’s allowlist can access a protected branch. Typically, branches containing production or sensitive data are designated as protected.

For details on configuring a protected branch, please refer to our [Protected branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches) guide.

### Large database support (beta)

We are currently testing architecture changes to support large databases from 300 GiB to 2 TiB. Access to this feature is limited to paying users by request. If you want to try it out, you can request access from the **Beta** tab under **Project Settings**, or use this direct link:

- [Request support for large database](http://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=request_large_db)

<div style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-70px' }} id="neon-serverless-driver-jsr-package"></div>
### Neon Serverless driver JavaScript Registry (JSR) package

The Neon serverless driver is now available as a [JavaScript Registry (JSR)](https://jsr.io/docs/introduction) package.

```bash
@neon/serverless
```

The JavaScript Registry (JSR) is a package registry for JavaScript and TypeScript. JSR works with many runtimes (Node.js, Deno, browsers, and more) and is backward compatible with `npm`. For example, to install using `npm`:

```bash
npm install @neon/serverless
```

For a deeper dive, check out this blog post announcing support for this feature: [Neon Serverless Driver on JSR](https://neon.tech/blog/neon-serverless-driver-on-jsr)

### Fixes & improvements

- You can now view the last active time for a compute endpoint associated with your branch, which is useful for determining which branches you have accessed recently. In the Neon Console, you can view the **Last active** time on the **Branches** page or in the **Computes** section on individual branch pages. Additionally, the Neon API [Get a compute endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getprojectendpoint) method response now includes a `last_active` field.
- The Neon SQL Editor now uses the Neon serverless driver for database connections. If you utilize the Neon [IP Allow](/docs/introduction/ip-allow) feature and your public IP address isn't currently on the allowlist, you may encounter a pop-up when you next query your database through the Neon SQL Editor. This pop-up requests permission to add your IP address to the allowlist.
- Resolved a problem with the Neon Vercel Integration where enabling automatic branch deletion resulted in the unintended removal of the `vercel-dev` branch after it was renamed.
- Resolved an issue where database connections could remain open longer than necessary. We now ensure that connections are forcibly closed if the client has disconnected.
- Fixed a table and selector display issue in the Neon console for long branch names.
- Fixed an SQL Editor issue that occurred when using the project breadcrumb selector from the SQL Editor page.
- Fixed an error in the message displayed after a successful branch reset operation in the console. The "reset from" branch name was not shown.
