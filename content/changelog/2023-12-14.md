### Quickstart

We've revised the **Quickstart** panel that appears at the top of the Neon project **Dashboard** after creating a new project. Follow this Quickstart to learn about [passwordless authentication](/docs/connect/passwordless-connect), installing the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli), integrating your apps with Neon, and importing data into your project.

### Fixes & improvements

- Fixed the **Create Support Ticket** form that is accessed from the **Support** link in the Neon Console sidebar. The form was not functioning properly.
- Fixed the **Cancel** link in the drawer that opens when you request an integration on the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console. Clicking **Cancel** now closes the drawer, as expected.
