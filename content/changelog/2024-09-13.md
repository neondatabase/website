### This week’s changelog – Live from Lisbon!

![Neon Team Portugal](/docs/relnotes/neon_team.jpg)

Our team is in Lisbon this week, wrapping up Q3 and refining our roadmap. It's been a great opportunity to reconnect, welcome new colleagues, meet with customers, and ensure we're delivering on the features and improvements our users are asking for.

As we look ahead as a team, here's a quick look back at some key features we've released over the past few months:

- **Inbound Logical Replication**: Enables low-downtime migrations to Neon from other providers and between Neon projects. Check out our guides on [Replicating Data to Neon](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide#replicate-data-to-neon) and [Project-to-Project Replication](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon-to-neon).
- **Organizations**: Now available for Early Access users. This long-requested feature allows you to create and manage your organization's projects and teams from a single account. Join our [Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) and refer to the [Organizations docs](/docs/manage/organizations) for more information.
- **Autoscaling GA**: Neon's Autoscaling feature is now generally available, automatically adjusting resources as needed. Read the announcement [here](https://neon.tech/blog/neon-autoscaling-is-generally-available) and explore the [Autoscaling docs](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).
- **Autoscaling on Free Plan**: Free Plan users can now experience Neon's Autoscaling. Learn more in the [Autoscaling Guide](/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide).
- **A New Business Plan**: Offers 500 GiB of storage and 1,000 compute hours, with potential cost savings for customers needing more storage than offered by our Scale plan. Learn more on our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) and [Plans](/docs/introduction/plans) pages.

We do have a few small updates to share this week, which you can check out below.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- Resolved an issue in the Neon Console where a banner incorrectly indicated that the monthly storage limit was reached or nearly reached after a project had been deleted.
- Improved the information provided on the **Create new branch** page and **Reset branch** modals.
- For Early Access users, the **Created by** column on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console now displays the creation source for branches created via GitHub or the [Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel#add-the-neon-vercel-integration) when BitBucket or GitHub is used as the source repository. Hovering over the creation source will trigger a pop-up that provides links to an associated preview, repository, or code branch, where applicable.
- Improved the information about history retention provided on the **Settings** &#8594; **Storage** page in the Neon Console.
- Improved how data is displayed in the **Replication delay bytes** and **Replication delay seconds** graphs on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console. The line segment was not displayed properly.
- Feedback, Support, Docs, and Changelog links were moved from the Neon Console sidebar to a **Help** menu at the top of the console. Look for a "?" icon.
- The number of reserved connections for the Neon-managed Postgres `superuser` account was increased from 4 to 7.
- The Time Travel toggle in the Neon SQL Editor is now accessible via a new icon above the editor window.
