## Introducing psql.sh — run psql directlyin your browser

We're excited to launch [psql.sh](https://psql.sh), a browser-based version of the PostgreSQL command-line client. This new tool lets you instantly spin up a fresh database and start running SQL queries and psql commands right in your browser.

psql.sh uses Neon's branching to create instant, isolated database environments for you to experiment with. Try it out at [psql.sh](https://psql.sh), or read about how we built it in our blog post [psql from the browserhttps://neon.tech/blog/psql-from-the-browser.

## Larger compute sizes are here

We’ve added support for larger compute sizes:

- Neon's autoscaling feature now supports a maximum setting of **16 vCPUs**. For configurations with a maximum limit of 10 vCPUs or higher, the maximum cannot exceed 8 times the minimum setting. For example, if your minimum is set to 2 vCPUs, your maximum can't exceed 16 vCPUs.
- Neon's Business and Enterprise plans now support fixed compute sizes up to **56 vCPUs**. Autoscaling is not supported for compute sizes larger than 16 vCPU.

## Project-scoped API keys

We now support per-project API keys, offering you finer-grained access control by limiting an API key's permissions to a particular project. This applies to organization-owned projects only — when creating an Organization API key, include the project ID in the request and the resulting key will be scoped to just that project. This key grantsmember-level permissions only, preventing destructive actions like deleting the project.

For more detail, see [Project-scoped API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#project-scoped-api-keys).

### Support for pgvector 0.8.0

Neon now supports [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) version 0.8.0. This new version adds support for iterative index scans, adds casts for arrays to `sparsevec`, and improves the performance of HNSW inserts and on-disk HNSW index builds.

For the full list of updates, refer to the [pgvector changelog](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Console updates**

  Fixed scrolling issues with the **SQL Editor** and the branches list on the **Branches** page. Both vertical and horizontal scrolling now work as expected.

- **Fixes**
  - Improved custom date/time selector to default to current time, use standardized UTC format (`2006-01-02T15:04:05Z`), and accept manual entries in the same format.
  - Fixed the **Current billing for this period** total displayed on the **Billing summary** page to correctly reflect archive storage costs and current pricing. Note this was a display issue only; actual bills were unaffected.
