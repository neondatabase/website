title: Larger compute sizes, project-scoped API keys, and a browser-based psql client
---

## Larger compute sizes are here

We’ve added support for larger compute sizes:

- Neon's autoscaling feature now supports a maximum setting of **16 vCPU**. Compute sizes larger than 8 vCPU are available on our Business and Enterprise plans.
- Neon's Business and Enterprise plans now support fixed compute sizes up to **56 vCPU**. Autoscaling is not yet supported for compute sizes larger than 16 vCPU but [reach out to us](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) if you'd like to extend your limit beyond that.

## Project-scoped API keys

We now support per-project API keys, offering you finer-grained access control by limiting an API key's permissions to a particular project. This applies to organization-owned projects only — when creating an Organization API key, include the project ID in the request and the resulting key will be scoped to just that project. This key grants member-level permissions only, preventing destructive actions like deleting the project.

For more details, see [Create project-scoped API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-project-scoped-organization-api-keys).

## Introducing psql.sh: run psql directly in your browser

We're excited to launch [psql.sh](https://psql.sh), a browser-based version of the PostgreSQL command-line client. This new tool lets you instantly spin up a fresh database and start running SQL queries and `psql` commands right in your browser.

`psql.sh` uses Neon's branching to create instant, isolated database environments for you to experiment with. Try it out at [psql.sh](https://psql.sh), or read about how we built it in our blog post: [psql from the browser](https://neon.tech/blog/psql-from-the-browser).

### Support for pgvector 0.8.0

Neon now supports [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) version 0.8.0. This new version adds support for iterative index scans, casts for arrays to `sparsevec`, and improves the performance of HNSW inserts and on-disk HNSW index builds.

For the full list of updates, refer to the [pgvector changelog](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

If you installed this extension previously and want to upgrade to the latest version, please refer to [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version) for instructions.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Console updates**

  Fixed scrolling issues with the **SQL Editor** and the branches list on the **Branches** page. Both vertical and horizontal scrolling now work as expected.

- **Fixes**
  - Improved the custom date/time selector to default to the current time, use standardized UTC format (`2006-01-02T15:04:05Z`), and accept manual entries in the same format.
  - Fixed the **Current billing for this period** total displayed on the **Billing summary** page to correctly reflect archive storage costs and current pricing. Note this was a display issue only; actual bills were unaffected.
