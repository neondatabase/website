title: Support for Postgres 17, SQL Editor AI features, and a toolkit for AI agents

### Support for Postgres 17

We're excited to announce that [Neon now supports Postgres 17](https://neon.tech/blog/postgres-17). To start using Postgres 17, create a new Neon project and select **17** as the **Postgres version**. For detailed instructions, refer to our [Create a project guide](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

If you need to migrate data from an existing Neon project to one running Postgres 17, check out our [Upgrading your Postgres version](/docs/postgresql/postgres-upgrade) guide for supported migration options.

As always, it's important to thoroughly test before migrating production data or applications. We recommend reviewing the key changes in Postgres 17, which you can find in the [Postgres Release 17 documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-17.html).

### Early Access to AI Features in Neon SQL Editor

[Join our Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to try out the AI features we're testing in the Neon SQL Editor.

Explore three AI-driven features:

- **SQL generation**: Convert natural language requests to SQL with ease. Press the ✨ button or use **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M**, type your request, and the AI assistant will generate the corresponding SQL. It’s schema-aware, so you can reference table names, functions, and other objects in your schema.
  ![SQL generation](/docs/get-started-with-neon/sql_editor_ai.png)
- **Fix with AI**: When your query returns an error, click **Fix with AI** next to the error message. The AI assistant will analyze the issue, suggest a fix, and update the SQL Editor so you can run the query again.
  ![Fix with AI](/docs/get-started-with-neon/fix_with_ai.png)
- **AI-generated query names**: Queries in the Neon SQL Editor's **History** are automatically assigned descriptive names. This feature helps you quickly identify and reuse previous queries.

### A new Postgres toolkit for AI agents and test environments

We're excited to announce an experimental release of the [@neondatabase/toolkit](https://github.com/neondatabase/toolkit) ([@neon/toolkit](https://jsr.io/@neon/toolkit) on JSR). This toolkit lets you spin up a Postgres database in seconds and run SQL queries. It includes both the [Neon API Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neondatabase/api-client) and the [Neon Serverless Driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless), making it an excellent choice for AI agents that need to quickly set up an SQL database, or for test environments where manually deploying a new database isn't practical.

With a few lines of code, you can create a Postgres database on Neon, run SQL queries, and tear down the database when you're done. Here's a quick look:

```javascript
import { NeonToolkit } from "@neondatabase/toolkit";

const toolkit = new NeonToolkit(process.env.API_KEY!);
const project = await toolkit.createProject();

await toolkit.sql(
  project,
  `
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
        users (
            id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        );
`,
);

await toolkit.sql(
  project,
  `
    INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'Sam Altman');
`,
);

console.log(
  await toolkit.sql(
    project,
    `
    SELECT name FROM users;
`,
  ),
);

await toolkit.deleteProject(project);
```

As with all of our experimental features, changes are ongoing. If you have any feedback, we'd love to hear it. Let us know via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or our [feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042) on Discord.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- Released a new version of the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli) with the following updates:

  - Fixed an issue where the `neon -v` command returned `unknown` instead of the CLI version.
  - Updated the [neon projects create](/docs/reference/cli-projects#create) CLI command to support creating projects in the `aws-ap-southeast-2` region, which was missing from the list of supported regions.
  - Added a warning to the [neon branches create](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create) CLI command output for branches created from a protected parent branch. The warning notes that role passwords are changed. For more details, see [New passwords generated for Postgres roles on child branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches#new-passwords-generated-for-postgres-roles-on-child-branches).

  To update your Neon CLI version, follow our [CLI upgrade instructions](/docs/reference/cli-install#upgrade).

- The Drizzle Studio version that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated. For improvements and fixes in this version, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
- We removed a restriction that prevented using the [Schema Diff](/docs/guides/schema-diff) feature when [IP Allow](/docs/introduction/ip-allow) was enabled. Previously, Schema Diff couldn't compare branches protected by an IP Allow list.
- Fixed an issue where timestamp values were displayed incorrectly on the **Tables** page. Timestamps were stored in UTC but shown in the user's local time zone.
- Improved error messages on the **Tables** page after a Drizzle Studio connection failure.
- The **Refresh** button on the **Monitoring** page now correctly refreshes any charts displaying an error.
- Branch deletion operations triggered by a new preview deployment in the Neon Vercel Integration are now performed asynchronously, allowing preview deployment operations to proceed without delay.
- Improved handling of long names for projects, branches, roles, and databases in the Neon Console.
- Fixed an issue in the Neon Quickstart where the connection string would disappear and reappear.
- Fixed an issue with storage usage values not updating correctly at the start of a new billing period after deleting all projects and downgrading.
