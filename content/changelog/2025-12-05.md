## 70 projects on the Free plan

We've increased the project limit on the Free plan to **70 projects**.

![Free plan 70 projects](/docs/changelog/free_plan_70_projects.png)

That's 70 separate database projects you can spin up, experiment with, and build on. Whether you're prototyping ideas, learning Postgres, or running multiple side projects, you've got plenty of room to work.

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users. No action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Postgres version updates

We updated supported Postgres versions to [14.20](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.20/), [15.15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.15/), [16.11](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.11/), [17.7](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.7/), and [18.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/18.1/), respectively.

When a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts. For more about how we handle Postgres version upgrades, refer to our [Postgres version support policy](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).

## New Data API advanced settings

The [Neon Data API](/docs/data-api/get-started) provides a ready-to-use REST API for your Neon database, letting you query tables, views, and functions using standard HTTP requests. We've added two new options to the **Advanced settings** panel:

- **OpenAPI mode** — Enables automatic generation of an OpenAPI schema for your Data API. Use it to generate API documentation, build typed client libraries, import your API into Postman, or integrate with API gateways.
- **Enable server timing headers** — Adds `Server-Timing` headers to API responses, showing how long different parts of each request took to process. Use this to debug slow queries, measure performance, and troubleshoot latency issues.

To learn more about Data API advanced settings, see [Manage Data API](/docs/data-api/manage).

## Neon is now a Kiro Power

[Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) announced **powers** at **AWS re:Invent** — a new way for developers to access curated tools directly from the IDE. Neon is one of the first launch partners, alongside Figma, Stripe, and Postman.

![Kiro Neon Power](/docs/changelog/kiro_power.png)

With the Neon power, you can manage your Postgres databases without leaving Kiro:

- **Deploy instantly** — Provision a Neon database in seconds whenever your workflow needs a Postgres backend.
- **Branch for safe testing** — Create lightweight, isolated copies of your database to test migrations, validate queries, or run integration tests without touching production.
- **Time-travel and restore** — Roll back to any past state, inspect historical data, or restore from a previous point in time.

## Custom Neon agents for GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot now supports custom agents, and we've built two specialized agents that bring Neon's branching workflow directly into your IDE:

- [**Neon Migration Specialist**](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/agents/neon-migration-specialist.agent.md) — Safe Postgres migrations with zero downtime. Test schema changes in isolated database branches, validate, then apply to production—all automated with support for Prisma, Drizzle, or your favorite ORM.

- [**Neon Performance Analyzer**](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/agents/neon-optimization-analyzer.agent.md) — Identify and fix slow Postgres queries automatically. Analyzes execution plans, tests optimizations in isolated branches, and provides clear before/after performance metrics with actionable code fixes.

Both agents leverage Neon's instant branching to give you a safe environment for testing database changes before they hit production.

To learn more about using these agents, see [Neon agents for GitHub Copilot](/docs/ai/ai-github-copilot-agents).

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Computes**
  - Scale to zero is no longer available for computes larger than 16 CU. To ensure best performance, large computes remain always active. For more information, see [Configuring Scale to Zero](/docs/guides/scale-to-zero-guide).
  - The default minimum autoscaling compute size for new projects is now 0.25 CU across all Neon plans (Free, Launch, and Scale). This change does not affect existing projects. You can update your default compute size settings in your [project settings](/docs/manage/projects#change-your-projects-default-compute-settings).

- **Vercel integration**
  - Fixed an issue where data transfer quota exceeded errors were not properly reported when creating branches through the Vercel integration.
  - Added safety checks to prevent accidental deletion of default branches, protected branches, and branches with children during Vercel deployment cleanup.
  - Fixed an issue where project deletion failed when removing a Vercel native integration if the project had protected branches. Protected branches are now automatically unprotected before deletion.
  - Fixed an issue where the wrong database role was selected in Vercel integration settings when switching between different Neon projects.

- **Data masking**
  - Added new masking options: **random unique email** for columns with uniqueness constraints, **random int/bigint/date between** for customizable value ranges (also supports timestamp columns), and **dummy name**, **fake IBAN**, and **dummy credit card number** for generating realistic fake data.
  - The "Replace with NULL" masking option is no longer shown for non-nullable columns.
  - Fixed an issue where the **Apply masking rules** button on the **Data masking** page showed an infinite loading spinner for branches with no applied masking rules.

- **Neon API**
  - The [Retrieve role details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getprojectbranchrole) endpoint now returns an `authentication_method` field indicating how the role authenticates (`password`, `oauth`, or `no_login`).
