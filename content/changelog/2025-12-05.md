## 100 projects on the Free plan

We've been increasing project limits on the Free plan over the past several weeks, and we've now hit a milestone: **100 projects**.

That's 100 separate database projects you can spin up, experiment with, and build on. Whether you're prototyping ideas, learning Postgres, or running multiple side projects, you've got plenty of room to work.

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users. No action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Custom Neon agents for GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot now supports custom agents, and we've built two specialized agents that bring Neon's branching workflow directly into your IDE:

- [**Neon Migration Specialist**](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/agents/neon-migration-specialist.agent.md) — Safe Postgres migrations with zero downtime. Test schema changes in isolated database branches, validate, then apply to production—all automated with support for Prisma, Drizzle, or your favorite ORM.

- [**Neon Performance Analyzer**](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/agents/neon-optimization-analyzer.agent.md) — Identify and fix slow Postgres queries automatically. Analyzes execution plans, tests optimizations in isolated branches, and provides clear before/after performance metrics with actionable code fixes.

Both agents leverage Neon's instant branching to give you a safe environment for testing database changes before they hit production.

To learn more about using these agents, see [Neon agents for GitHub Copilot](/docs/ai/ai-github-copilot-agents).

## Postgres version updates

We updated supported Postgres versions to [14.20](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.20/), [15.15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.15/), [16.11](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.11/), [17.7](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.7/), and [18.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/18.1/), respectively.

When a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts (for any reason). For more about how we handle Postgres version upgrades, refer to our [Postgres version support policy](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).
