## More projects on the Free plan

We’ve doubled the Free plan **project limit** from 10 to 20. No more one-in, one-out — add more side projects and prototypes without hitting the limit.

## Neon MCP Server enhancements

- We introduced a new **list_shared_projects** tool that lets users see projects shared with them. This addresses a gap where [project collaborators](/docs/guides/project-collaboration-guide) couldn’t list Neon projects they were part of. For an overview of Neon MCP Server tools, see [Supported tools](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#supported-actions-tools).
- We improved error handling and refined the logic used for Neon org selection.
- You can now manage your Neon database directly from **Claude Code** using the [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon) Check out our new guide to get started. It covers both remote (OAuth) and local setup options: [Get started with Claude Code and Neon Postgres MCP Server](/guides/claude-code-mcp-neon)
- Are you a Cursor user? Try the one-click Neon MCP Server install:

## Get started with Neon Local and Neon Local Connect

**Neon Local** and **Neon Local Connect** bring the power of Neon's cloud database branching directly to your local development environment.

- **Neon Local** is a Docker-based proxy that creates a smart local interface to your Neon database, providing a static connection that automatically routes to your active cloud database branch.

- **Neon Local Connect** extends this with a full-featured VS Code extension, offering database schema browsing, built-in SQL editing, table data management, and branch switching—all without leaving your IDE.

## Postgres `pg_repack` extension available on all Neon plans

The `pg_repack` extension lets you to efficiently remove bloat by rewriting tables and indexes online, with minimal locking.

Previously, enabling `pg_repack` required opening a support ticket so our team could grant you permission on the `repack` schema. That's no longer necessary — you now have access by default. No support ticket means the extension is available on all Neon plans.

> _If you previously installed `pg_repack` without assistance from Neon support, you'll need to [drop the extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html) and reinstall it on your database to apply the new `repack` schema permission._

Learn more about the extension in our docs: [pg_repack](/docs/extensions/pg_repack)
