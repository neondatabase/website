title: Neon Auth support for Vercel preview deployments
---

## Neon Auth now works with Vercel preview deployments

Both the [Vercel-managed](/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration) and [Neon-managed](/docs/guides/neon-managed-vercel-integration) integrations now automatically provision Neon Auth on preview branches when enabled on your production branch. Preview deployments get the `NEON_AUTH_BASE_URL` and `VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL` environment variables configured automatically.

Neon Auth provides managed authentication that stores user profiles in your database. When your database branches, auth data branches with it, making it easy to test authentication in isolated preview environments. [Learn more](/docs/auth/overview).
