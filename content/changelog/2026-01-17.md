title: Neon Auth for Vercel previews and custom data anonymization rules
---

## Neon Auth now works with Vercel preview deployments

Both the [Vercel-managed](/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration) and [Neon-managed](/docs/guides/neon-managed-vercel-integration) integrations now automatically provision Neon Auth on preview branches when enabled on your production branch. Preview deployments get the `NEON_AUTH_BASE_URL` and `VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL` environment variables configured automatically.

Neon Auth provides managed authentication that stores user profiles in your database. When your database branches, auth data branches with it, making it easy to test authentication in isolated preview environments. [Learn more](/docs/auth/overview).

## Custom rules for data anonymization

[Data anonymization](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization) now supports custom rules via the Neon API. Define masking rules using any PostgreSQL expression or function—like conditional `CASE` statements, custom functions, or combinations of masking functions—giving you flexibility beyond the built-in masking functions for domain-specific anonymization needs.
