title: Support for the AWS SÃ£o Paulo region, a Neon Auth update, and more
---

## SÃ£o Paulo AWS region now generally available ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

Neon is now generally available in AWS's SÃ£o Paulo region (`sa-east-1`). Create projects in the SÃ£o Paulo region for lower latency access from South America and to keep your data within Brazil.

See all our supported [Regions](/docs/introduction/regions).

## Transfer projects between organizations ðŸ”„

You can now transfer projects from one organization to another directly from the Neon Console. Organization admins can move projects to any organization they're a member of, making it easier to manage projects across different organizations.

See [Transfer projects to an organization](/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer) to learn more.

## Create users directly from Neon Auth

Following last week's Neon Auth Beta release, we've now added the ability to create new users directly from the Neon Console. Add test users to your project without leaving your database environment â€” get started trying out Neon Auth with users right away.

## Manage your database from Cline or Windsurf

Following last week's guides for [Cursor](https://neon.tech/guides/cursor-mcp-neon) and [Claude Desktop](https://neon.tech/guides/neon-mcp-server), you can now manage your Neon database directly from Cursor or Claude Desktop using natural language, made possible by the [Neon Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).

## Scheduled updates for Business plan accounts

A few weeks ago, we announced _scheduled updates_ for Neon, which include Postgres version upgrades, security patches, and Neon feature enhancements.

Updates only take a few seconds and are applied at the scheduled time or the next time your compute restarts.

Updates for Business plan accounts will start rolling out next week. You can check for updates notices and choose a preferred update window â€” [learn how](/docs/manage/updates#updates-on-paid-plans).

_Computes larger than 8 CU or configured to scale beyond 8 CU are not updated automatically._

For more information about updates, see our [Updates documentation](/docs/manage/updates). If you have questions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or [contact Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).

## Early Access Program now available for organizations ðŸ”“

Organization admins can now enable Early Access for their entire organization. Once enabled, all organization members can preview upcoming Neon features across their organization's projects.

## Postgres version updates

We updated supported Postgres versions to [14.17](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.17/), [15.12](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.12/), [16.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.8/), and [17.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.4/), respectively.

When a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts (for any reason). For more about how we handle Postgres version upgrades, refer to our [Postgres version support policy](/docs/postgresql/postgres-version-policy).

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  - **Improved concurrent operations in Console**

    Recent improvements to concurrency handling in the API are now reflected in the Console. Buttons and controls are only disabled when strictly necessary, making it easier to work with multiple branches and endpoints simultaneously.

  - Restricted Neon Auth installation and removal to organization admins only

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  We updated the Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to version 1.0.15. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **API Updates**

  Updated the `@neondatabase/api-client` package to include Neon Auth API endpoints

- **Neon serverless driver**

  Updated dependencies in the [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to address security advisories. If you use the driver in your applications, we recommend updating it to the latest version.

- **Fixes**
  - Fixed performance issues with database and role operations by preventing duplicate API requests
  - Improved the **Restore** UI to preserve your selections when switching between restore options
  - Fixed an issue where connection strings could show the `postgres` role instead of Neon's `neondb_owner` when working with migrated databases
  - Fixed inconsistent storage usage reporting for free tier accounts, ensuring the Billing page now correctly shows total storage usage instead of GB-months
