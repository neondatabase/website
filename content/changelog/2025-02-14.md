title: New London AWS region, Datadog integration now GA, and more
---

## London AWS region now generally available üá¨üáß ‚ù§Ô∏è

Neon is now generally available in AWS's London region (eu-west-2). Create projects in the London region for lower latency access from the UK and to keep your data within the United Kingdom.

See all our supported [Regions](/docs/introduction/regions).

## Datadog integration now generally available üéâ

Our Datadog integration has graduated from beta and is now generally available for Scale and Business plan users. The integration lets you monitor your Neon database performance, resource utilization, and system health directly from Datadog's observability platform.

Learn more about setting up the integration and available metrics in our [Datadog integration guide](/docs/guides/datadog).

## Inbound Logical Replication is also GA üîÑ

Inbound logical replication (replicating data to Neon), where Neon is configured as a subscriber in a Postgres logical replication setup, is now GA. This feature lets you perform live data migrations to Neon from external Postgres sources such as AWS RDS, Aurora, Google Cloud SQL ‚Äî or any other platform running Postgres. To try it out, get started with one of our [Logical Replication Guides](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide#replicate-data-to-neon).

## MAX connection limit added to Connections graph

We've enhanced the **Connections count** graph in the Monitoring page to display your compute's maximum connection limit. This makes it easier to visualize how many connections you're using relative to your compute's capacity.

![Maximum connections monitoring](/docs/relnotes/max_connections_monitoring.png)

The new **MAX** line shows your connection ceiling based on your compute size, helping you:

- Monitor connection usage relative to your limit
- Make informed decisions about implementing connection pooling

For more details about monitoring connections, see [Monitoring](/docs/introduction/monitoring-page#connections-count).

## Neon Auth improvements for Early Access users

We've made several enhancements to Neon Auth during the Early Access period:

- **Neon-managed Stack Auth**: You can now automatically provision a pre-configured Stack Auth project with recommended security settings
- **Post-setup guidance**: Added real-world examples showing how to relate user data with the rest of your application
- **Schema improvements**: Updated the `users_sync` table schema to include an `updated_at` field for better tracking of synchronization status
- **Transfer ownership**: For Neon-managed Stack Auth projects created using the Quickstart option, you can later decide to transfer ownership to your own Stack Auth account, at any time.

For Early Access users already using Neon Auth, these improvements make it easier to get started. Join our [Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to try Neon Auth, or read the [docs](/docs/guides/neon-auth) to learn more.

## Scheduled updates for Launch & Scale accounts

A few weeks ago, we announced _scheduled updates_ for Neon, including Postgres version upgrades, security patches, and Neon feature enhancements.

Updates, which take only a few seconds, are applied at the scheduled time or the next time your compute restarts.

Launch and Scale Plan users will start seeing update notices early next week. We aim to provide 7 days' notice for updates on paid plans. You can choose a preferred update window ‚Äî [learn how](/docs/manage/updates#updates-on-paid-plans).

![Paid plan updates UI](/docs/manage/paid_plan_updates.png)

We also support checking for scheduled updates and configuring update windows programmatically using the [Neon API](/docs/manage/updates#check-for-updates-using-the-neon-api).

We plan to introduce scheduled updates for Business and Enterprise accounts toward the end of this month.

For more information about scheduled updates, see our [Updates documentation](/docs/manage/updates). If you have questions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or [contact Neon Support](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support).
