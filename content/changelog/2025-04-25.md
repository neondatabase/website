title: Early Access for Neon Snapshots, export Postgres logs to Datadog, and more
---

## Neon Snapshots now available in Early Access

We're very happy to announce Early Access to **Neon Snapshots**, a powerful new way to capture and restore point-in-time copies of your database. Snapshots let you preserve your database state before making changes, running migrations, or simply bookmark a stable state.

![Backup branch on the Branches page](/docs/guides/backup_restore_create_snapshot.png)

With this update, we've also revamped our **Backup & Restore** page to provide a unified experience for both snapshots and instant restore (PITR) operations. Join our [Early Access Program](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) to try it out.

Read more about Neon Snapshots in our [blog](https://neon.tech/blog/announcing-neon-snapshots-a-smoother-path-to-recovery) and the [docs](/docs/guides/backup-restore).

_Support for scheduled snapshots, custom retention periods, and API/CLI integration coming later this year._

## Postgres logs support for Datadog

We've added beta support for Postgres log exports to Datadog. You can now stream and analyze your database logs directly in your Datadog dashboard for better, centralized observability. Available on Scale and Business plans.

For more information, see [Datadog Integration with Neon](/docs/guides/datadog).

## pg_search extension now available on Postgres 14, 15, and 16

We've updated the `pg_search` extension to version 0.15.16 and expanded support to Postgres 14, 15, and 16 (previously only available on Postgres 17). This powerful full-text search extension enables you to implement advanced search capabilities in your applications with minimal configuration.

To use `pg_search`, you'll need to load the required libraries with a simple Update project API call before installing the extension. Detailed instructions are available in our documentation: [Enable the pg_search extension](/docs/extensions/pg_search#enable-the-pgsearch-extension).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  - You can now find the **Monitoring** page under the **Branches** list in the sidebar. This is a bit of polish to our navigation: you now access Monitoring within your selected branch. If you want to monitor a different branch, use the main breadcrumb selector to change branches.
  - Fixed an issue where you sometimes could not access a branch if the branch creator's account was deleted. You can now view and access these branches normally.
  - Added a warning message when editing compute settings to help you plan for potential connection interruptions and temporary performance impacts when changing compute size.

- **Neon MCP Server**

  - Released version 0.3.7 with improved Neon Auth setup instructions and compatibility with the latest Serverless Driver (1.0.0).

- **Read replica compute limit on the Free plan**

  - To ensure consistent performance, we've introduced a limit of 3 read replica computes per project on the Free plan. This change helps maintain stability while still supporting common read scaling and analytics use cases.

- **PgBouncer version update**

  - The PgBouncer version used by Neon to offer pooled connection support was updated to [version 1.24.1](https://www.pgbouncer.org/changelog.html#pgbouncer-124x)
