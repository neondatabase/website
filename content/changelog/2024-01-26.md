### New default Postgres version

The default version for newly created Neon projects is now Postgres 16. Neon continues to support Postgres 14 and 15.

### Configurable environment variables for Vercel Integration

- The [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) is now supported with applications sourced in GitLab and Bitbucket. Previously, the integration only worked with applications stored in GitHub.
- The environment variables set by the Neon Vercel Integration when you add the integration to a Vercel project have changed. Previously, the integration set the following Postgres variables:

  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `PGHOST`
  - `PGUSER`
  - `PGDATABASE`
  - `PGPASSWORD`

  The integration now sets **only** the `DATABASE_URL` variable by default, which includes all of the required details for connecting to your Neon database.

  If you prefer to use the other Postgres variables with your application instead of `DATABASE_URL`, you can now configure the variables you want on the **Integrations** page in the Neon console.

  The variables you select are set in your Vercel project on your next `git push`. For details, see [Manage Vercel integration settings](/docs/guides/vercel#manage-vercel-integration-settings).

- Fixed an issue that prevented the `DATABASE_URL` variable from being set on the first preview deployment after adding the integration to a Vercel project.

### Fixes & improvements

- The [List projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) API method now returns only projects owned by the current user account. Previously, it also returned projects shared with the current user account. To list projects shared with the current user account, use the [List shared projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listsharedprojects) API method instead.
- Added a **Submit feedback** form to the cards on the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console, letting users share their experience with Neon integrations.
- We now expose more details in error messages returned from the Neon proxy for [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) connections over HTTP.
- Improved the [IP Allow](/docs/introduction/ip-allow) user interface with minor design and copy adjustments.
