title: New snapshot restore options, set expiration dates for branches, and more

## New snapshot restore options (Early Access)

We've added new snapshot restore workflows that let you choose how you want to restore from your existing snapshots:

- **One-step restore** instantly restores a selected snapshot to the current branch
- **Multi-step restore** creates a new branch from the selected snapshot, which you can then inspect or test before finalizing the restore

These restore methods are also available via the Neon API for building AI agent checkpoints and other automated workflows.

To try out these snapshot features, sign up for the [Early Access Program](/docs/introduction/early-access). Learn more in our [backup and restore guide](/docs/guides/backup-restore).

## Set expiration dates for branches (Early Access)

**Early Access** users can now set an expiry date to automatically delete branches at a specified time, helping keep projects clean and reduce storage costs for temporary branches.

![setting branch expiration date from neon console](/docs/relnotes/branch_expiration.png)

To give your branch an end date, set the `expires_at` timestamp when creating or updating the branch via the API, CLI, or Neon Console, up to 30 days ahead of time. When that time comes, the branch and its compute endpoints are permanently deleted.

**Use cases**

- CI/CD pipelines with ephemeral test branches
- Time-boxed feature development
- Temporary demos or testing environments
- AI workflows requiring automated cleanup

To try branch expiration and other upcoming features, sign up for the [Early Access Program](/docs/introduction/early-access).

## Quick access to Neon Local Connect from your dashboard

You can now easily access the **Neon Local Connect** VS Code extension directly from the **Getting started** widget on your Project Dashboard. This makes it faster to set up your development environment with the localhost connection experience.
