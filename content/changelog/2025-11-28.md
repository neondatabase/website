title: 60 Free plan projects, AI onboarding for VS Code & Claude, platform integrations
---

## More projects on the Free plan

Another week, another increase: The Neon Free plan now includes:

- ~~50 projects~~
- **60 projects**

More projects means more room to experiment, prototype, and build without worrying about limits.

![Dashboard page showing 60 Free Plan projects](/docs/changelog/free_plan_projects_60.png)

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users. No action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## AI-powered Neon setup expands to VS Code and Claude

The one-command Neon setup, which configures the Neon MCP Server for AI-assisted project onboarding, now supports **VS Code with GitHub Copilot** and **Claude Code CLI** in addition to Cursor.

Run this command in your project directory:

```bash
npx neonctl@latest init

```

After setup, ask your AI assistant to **"Get started with Neon"** to launch an interactive onboarding guide. The guide analyzes your codebase and walks you through selecting or creating a project, configuring connection strings, installing dependencies, and more, all with contextual recommendations.

## HIPAA support now available for Postgres 18

HIPAA compliance is now supported for Postgres 18 projects in AWS regions. You can now create Postgres 18 projects in HIPAA-enabled Neon organizations and enable HIPAA compliance on existing Postgres 18 projects.

For more information, see [HIPAA compliance](/docs/security/hipaa).

## Four ways platforms integrate with Neon

Whether you're building an agent platform, a developer tool that needs instant Postgres, or a SaaS that offers databases to users, there's a [platform integration path](/docs/guides/platform-integration-overview) designed for your use case:

☑ **AI Agents integration** — For codegen and agent platforms that need database versioning and isolated environments (platforms like [Replit](https://neon.com/blog/replit-app-history-powered-by-neon-branches) and CMS systems like [Strapi](https://strapi.io))

☑ **Claimable database flow** — For plugins and platforms that want instant Postgres as part of their developer experience, with no signup required upfront (see [TanStack](https://neon.com/blog/neon-joins-tanstack-instant-postgres-integration-for-faster-javascript-development), [Netlify DB](https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-db-database-for-ai-native-development/), or try [Instagres](https://neon.new/) at `neon.new`)

☑ **Embedded Postgres** — For SaaS platforms offering Postgres to users (platforms like [Retool](https://neon.com/blog/how-retool-uses-retool-and-the-neon-api-to-manage-300k-postgres-databases), which manages 300k+ databases, and [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/blog/serverless-postgres-public-preview), which offers serverless Postgres)

☑ **OAuth integration** — For tools that interact with existing Neon accounts (platforms like [Hasura Cloud](https://hasura.io/), which uses OAuth for authentication and database provisioning)

If you're building an agent platform, check out the [Neon Agent Plan](https://neon.com/use-cases/ai-agents), designed specifically for platforms that need to manage large fleets of databases with flexible resource limits and instant provisioning. Early-stage startups can also apply to the [Neon Startup Program](https://neon.com/startups) for startup credits.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Backup & Restore**
  - The backup schedule dialog on the **Backup & Restore** page in the Neon Console now displays validation errors for the snapshot retention period field when invalid values are entered.

- **Tables page**
  - Fixed an unexpected error that users encountered when accessing the **Tables** page in the Neon Console after reaching usage limits.

- **Postgres extensions**
  - The `pg_session_jwt` extension has been updated to version 0.4.0. This extension provides JWT session management functionality used by the [Data API](/docs/data-api/get-started).

- **Data anonymization**
  - Improved the search functionality on the **Data anonymization** page. When you search for a column name, matching tree view branches are now automatically expanded to show tables containing those columns. If no results match your search, an informational message appears below the search input.
  - Fixed an issue where anonymization failed for tables with non-lowercase names. Table names are now properly quoted to handle uppercase and mixed-case identifiers.
  - Added a banner alert that appears on branch pages when viewing a branch with masked data. The alert displays "This branch contains masked data" with a link to the **Data masking** page, helping you stay aware of which branches contain anonymized data.

- **Neon Auth**
  - Fixed an issue where the **Enable Neon Auth** button was hidden from view in all environments due to incorrect region and platform comparison logic.

- **Point-in-time restore**
  - Fixed point-in-time restore to correctly select the target branch. Previously, the restore operation incorrectly used the source branch as both the source and target, which could lead to unexpected results. The restore modal now also shows clearer information about the restore operation.

- **Project creation**
  - Added protection against accidental duplicate project creation. The **Create Project** button is now disabled during submission to prevent creating multiple projects when clicking repeatedly on slow network connections.

- **Support tickets**
  - The **Create support ticket** dialog now prompts users to allowlist `help@databricks.com`. If you're a Neon support user, be sure to add this address to your email allowlist to ensure support responses don't end up in spam or junk folders.
