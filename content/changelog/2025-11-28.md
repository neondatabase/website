title: 60 Free plan projects, HIPAA for Postgres 18, and platform integration paths
---

## More projects on the Free plan

We've increased the Free plan project limit again! The Neon Free plan now includes:

- ~~50 projects~~
- **60 projects**

This gives you even more room for side projects, prototypes, experiments, and learning new stacks.

![Dashboard page showing 60 Free Plan projects](/docs/changelog/free_plan_projects_60.png)

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users. No action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans). Learn more about [why we're increasing project limits on the Free plan](https://neon.com/blog/why-so-many-projects-in-the-neon-free-plan).

## HIPAA support now available for Postgres 18

HIPAA compliance is now supported for Postgres 18 projects AWS regions. You can create Postgres 18 projects in HIPAA-enabled Neon organizations and enable HIPAA compliance on existing Postgres 18 projects.

For more information about HIPAA compliance on Neon, see [HIPAA compliance](/docs/security/hipaa).

## Four ways platforms integrate with Neon

We've updated our [platform integration documentation](/docs/guides/platform-integration-overview) to cover all the ways partners and platforms integrate Neon Postgres into their applications. Whether you're building an AI agent system, a developer tool or plugin that needs instant Postgres, a SaaS platform that offers databases, or a monitoring tool, there's an integration path designed for your use case.

**AI Agents integration** — For codegen and agent platforms that need database versioning and isolated environments (platforms like [Replit](https://replit.com) and CMS systems like [Strapi](https://strapi.io))

**Claimable database flow** — For plugins and platforms that want instant Postgres as part of their developer experience, with no signup required upfront (see [TanStack](https://neon.com/blog/neon-joins-tanstack-instant-postgres-integration-for-faster-javascript-development), [Netlify DB](https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-db-database-for-ai-native-development/), or try [Instagres](https://neon.new/) at `neon.new`)

**Embedded Postgres** — For SaaS platforms offering Postgres to users (platforms like [Retool](https://neon.com/blog/how-retool-uses-retool-and-the-neon-api-to-manage-300k-postgres-databases), which manages 300k+ databases, and [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/blog/serverless-postgres-public-preview), which offers serverless Postgres)

**OAuth integration** — For tools that interact with existing Neon accounts (platforms like [Hasura Cloud](https://hasura.io/), which uses OAuth for authentication and database provisioning)

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Backup & Restore**
  - The backup schedule dialog on the **Backup & Restore** page in the Neon Console now displays validation errors for the snapshot retention period field when invalid values are entered.

- **Tables page**
  - Fixed an error that users encountered when accessing the **Tables** page in the Neon Console after reaching usage limits. The page now returns a proper 402 status code instead of an unexpected error.

- **Postgres extensions**
  - The [pg_session_jwt](/docs/data-api/get-started) extension has been updated to version 0.4.0. This extension provides JWT session management functionality used by the [Data API](/docs/data-api/get-started).

- **Data anonymization**
  - Improved the search functionality on the **Data anonymization** page. When you search for a column name and press Enter, matching tree view branches are now automatically expanded to show tables containing those columns. If no results match your search, an informational message appears below the search input.
  - Fixed an issue where anonymization failed for tables with non-lowercase names. Table names are now properly quoted to handle uppercase and mixed-case identifiers.
  - Added a banner alert that appears on branch pages when viewing a branch with masked data. The alert displays "This branch contains masked data" with a link to the **Data masking** page, helping you stay aware of which branches contain anonymized data.

- **Support tickets**
  - Updated the **Create support ticket** dialog to include a warning alert prompting users to whitelist the `help@databricks.com` email address to ensure support responses don't end up in spam or junk folders.

- **Neon Auth**
  - Fixed an issue where the **Enable Neon Auth** button was hidden from view in all environments due to incorrect region and platform comparison logic.

- **Point-in-time restore**
  - Fixed Point-in-Time Restore to correctly select the target branch. Previously, the restore operation incorrectly used the source branch as both the source and target, which could lead to unexpected results. The restore modal now also shows clearer information about which branch is being restored from and to.

- **Project creation**
  - Added protection against accidental duplicate project creation. The **Create Project** button is now disabled during submission to prevent creating multiple projects when clicking repeatedly on slow network connections.
