### Read Replicas on the Free Plan

You may have seen the announcement earlier this week: [Read replicas are now available in the Free Plan](https://neon.tech/blog/create-read-replicas-in-the-free-plan).

![Add read replica](/docs/relnotes/add_read_replica.png)

If you're not familiar Neon [Read Replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas), you might be interested to know that we take a fundamentally different approach by leveraging our serverless architecture. In Neon, read replicas are independent compute instances designed to handle read operations on the same data as your primary read-write compute. There's no replication or copying of data involved, allowing you to create a read replica almost instantly with no additional storage cost.

Neon's Read Replicas support a variety of use cases, including:

- Horizontal scaling
- Analytics and ad-hoc queries
- Read-only data access

### Postgres extension updates

We added support for several extensions to **Postgres 17**, including **pgvector 7.4**.

### Neon SQL Editor AI features are now open to everyone

The AI-driven features in the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) we opened to [Early Access](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/early-access) users a few weeks ago are now available to everyone. In case you missed that announcement, here's what's new:

- **SQL generation**: Convert natural language requests to SQL with ease. Press the ✨ button or use **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M**, type your request, and the AI assistant will generate the corresponding SQL. It’s schema-aware, so you can reference table names, functions, and other objects in your schema.
- **Fix with AI**: When your query returns an error, click **Fix with AI** next to the error message. The AI assistant will analyze the issue, suggest a fix, and update the SQL Editor so you can run the query again.
- **AI-generated query names**: Queries in the Neon SQL Editor's **History** are automatically assigned descriptive names. This feature helps you quickly identify and reuse previous queries.

To learn more, see [Neon SQL Editor AI features](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor#ai-features).

### Easier User to Org account conversion

We've introduced a new way to convert personal Neon accounts to organization accounts. Previously, this process required setting up a new organization, transferring projects, and entering billing details again. You can now convert your user account to an organization with a single action. This will instantly transfer all of your projects and billing to the new organization, with no service disruption and no changes to your connections. Your personal account will automatically switch to the Free Plan after conversion.

For more details on how to convert your account, see [Convert your personal account](/docs/manage/organizations#convert-your-personal-account).

And don't forget to check out this week's fixes and improvements:

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console enhancement**

  We added a **Settings** option to the Account navigation sidebar in the Neon Console for easier access to personal and organization account settings.
  ![Account settings](/docs/relnotes/account_settings.png)

- **Neon API changes**

  - Updated the [Create Project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) API to return a 404 error instead of a 500 error when an invalid region is specified.
  - Updated the `project_id` field for the `Get consumption metrics for each project` API. You can now specify project IDs as a comma-separated list in addition to an array of parameter values. This provides more flexibility when filtering responses by project. If omitted, the response will include all projects.
    - As an array: `project_ids=cold-poetry-09157238&project_ids=quiet-snow-71788278`
    - As a comma-separated list: `project_ids=cold-poetry-09157238,quiet-snow-71788278`

- **Fixes**

  We fixed an issue with the Neon Vercel Integration where the `PGPASSWORD` variable in Vercel was not defined as expected after enabling [branch protection](/docs/guides/protected-branches) on the main branch. Enabling branch protection resulted in a new password being generated for preview branches, rendering the existing `PGPASSWORD` setting invalid. To prevent this issue, a `PGPASSWORD` variable is now set for each new preview branch.
