## app.build ‚Äî now available via Homebrew

Last week, we introduced [app.build](https://www.app.build/), our open-source reference implementation for building AI-powered applications on top of Neon. Unlike LLMs that generate isolated snippets, `app.build` uses agent architecture to turn prompts into fully deployed, production-ready applications ‚Äî complete with frontend, backend, and a Neon Postgres database.

This week, in addition to installing `app.build` using `npx`, you can now install it using Homebrew.

üìå We also fixed an issue where newly built apps could flicker between the ‚ÄúUnder Construction‚Äù page and the actual app. Apps now load consistently.

## Neon MCP homepage & streamable HTTP support

- **Neon MCP Server now has a homepage** ‚Äî We‚Äôve launched a new homepage for the Neon MCP Server at [mcp.neon.tech](https://mcp.neon.tech), making it easier to understand what the MCP Server does and what tools it supports.

- **Streamable HTTP support** ‚Äî The Neon MCP Server now supports streamable HTTP as an alternative to Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses. This makes it easier to consume streamed data in environments where SSE is not ideal ‚Äî such as CLI tools, backend services, or AI agents. To use streamable HTTP, make sure to use the latest remote MCP server, and specify the `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` endpoint.

      }
    }
  }
  ```
