## app.build — now available via Homebrew

Last week, we introduced [app.build](https://www.app.build/), our open-source reference implementation for building AI-powered applications on top of Neon. Unlike LLMs that generate isolated snippets, `app.build` uses agent architecture to turn prompts into fully deployed, production-ready applications — complete with frontend, backend, and a Neon Postgres database.

This week, in addition to installing `app.build` using `npx`, you can now install it using Homebrew.

📌 We also fixed an issue where newly built apps could flicker between the “Under Construction” page and the actual app. Apps now load consistently.

## Neon MCP homepage & streamable HTTP support

- **Neon MCP Server now has a homepage** — We’ve launched a new homepage for the Neon MCP Server at [mcp.neon.tech](https://mcp.neon.tech), making it easier to understand what the MCP Server does and what tools it supports.

- **Streamable HTTP support** — The Neon MCP Server now supports streamable HTTP as an alternative to Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses. This makes it easier to consume streamed data in environments where SSE is not ideal — such as CLI tools, backend services, or AI agents. To use streamable HTTP, make sure to use the latest remote MCP server, and specify the `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` endpoint.

      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Neon Console**
  - We updated the **Instant point-in-time restore** time selector component on the **Backup & Restore** page. The new selector makes it a little easier to select the restore point time and date.
  - Fixed an issue in the console that prevented shared projects from being displayed.
