title: Develop with Neon in VS Code using Neon Local Connect, app.build adds Python support, and more
---

## Accelerate development with the Neon Local Connect VS Code Extension

The [Neon Local Connect VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=databricks.neon-local-connect) lets you develop with Neon using a familiar localhost connection string. Your app connects to `localhost:5432` like a local Postgres instance, but the underlying [Neon Local](/docs/local/neon-local) service routes traffic to your actual Neon branch in the cloud.

**Key features:**

- **Static connection string**: Use `postgres://neon:npg@localhost:5432/<your_database>` for all branches — no need to update your app config when switching branches
- **Branch management**: Create, switch, or reset branches directly from the VS Code panel
- **Ephemeral branches**: Automatically create and cleanup temporary branches for testing and experiments
- **Integrated tools**: Launch `psql` shell, **SQL Editor**, or **Table View** without leaving your IDE

The extension is available on both the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=databricks.neon-local-connect) and [OpenVSX Marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/databricks/neon-local-connect) (for **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, and **other VS Code forks**).

## app.build adds Python support

[app.build](https://www.app.build/), our open-source agent for turning AI-generated code snippets into full-stack, deployed applications on Neon, now supports building data apps and ML dashboards with Python.

You can try it today:

```bash
npx @app.build/cli --template=python
```

To learn more about `app.build` and its capabilities, read the [blog post](https://www.app.build/blog/appbuild-can-now-build-python-data-apps) and visit [app.build](https://www.app.build/).

## Storage performance improvements

We’ve made several upgrades to Neon’s storage layer to make your databases faster—especially for large and write-heavy workloads. Improvements include smarter sharding, compressed WAL transmission, faster disk writes, and more responsive compaction.

Most users will see better ingest performance, lower read latency, and faster uploads automatically.

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon MCP**
  - Addressed an issue where required tool parameters, such as `org-id`, were being passed with empty values, resulting in an undefined error.
  - We updated our security guidance for the Neon MCP Server. To learn more, see [MCP security guidance](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#mcp-security-guidance).

- **Neon API**
  - For [Neon Private Networking](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) users, you can now list all VPC endpoints for your Neon organization across regions using a new API endpoint. See [List VPC endpoints across all regions](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listorganizationvpcendpointsallregions) for details.

- **neon_superuser**

  The `neon_superuser` role is now granted the `pg_signal_backend` privilege, which allows it to cancel (terminate) backend sessions belonging to roles that are not members of `neon_superuser`.

  > Roles created in the Neon Console, CLI, or API, are granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. To learn more about this role, see [The neon_superuser role](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role).

- **Fixes**

  Resolved an issue on the **Tables** page in the Neon Console where the previously selected database was incorrectly cached across projects. This caused errors when switching to a project that didn’t include the cached database. The Tables page now correctly resets the selected database when switching projects.
