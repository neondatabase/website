## Help shape what we build in 2026

From the Neon team, we'd like to extend a warm and heartfelt Happy New Year to every member of our community.

What a year 2025 was. In May, [Neon joined Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-agrees-acquire-neon-help-developers-deliver-ai-systems), but our mission hasn't changed. We're still focused on delivering the best Postgres experience for developers and AI agents.

Beyond that, we shipped a ton of features in 2025. You can see [everything we built here](/docs/introduction/roadmap#what-weve-shipped-recently).

Here's the thing though, none of this happens without you. Your feedback, whether you chat with us in Discord, ping us on Twitter, or drop it in the console, that's what shapes what we build. Every suggestion, bug report, and feature request matters to us.

So as we kick off 2026, we want to ask **What should we ship next?**

Got a feature you're waiting for? A bug that's causing you trouble? An idea that would take things to the next level? We want to hear it.

You can share your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042), [Twitter/X](https://x.com/neondatabase), or via the **Send Feedback** modal in the Neon Console.

Thank you for being part of this journey with us. Let's build great things together in 2026! 🚀
