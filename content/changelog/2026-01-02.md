## Help shape what we build in 2026

From the Neon team, we'd like to extend a warm and heartfelt Happy New Year to every member of our community.

What a year 2025 was. In May, [Neon joined Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-agrees-acquire-neon-help-developers-deliver-ai-systems), but our mission hasn't changed: we're still focused on delivering the best Postgres experience for developers and AI agents.

Beyond that, we shipped a ton of features in 2025. You can see [everything we built here](/docs/introduction/roadmap#what-weve-shipped-recently).

Here's the thing though — none of this happens without you. Your feedback, whether you drop it in the console, ping us on Twitter, chat with us in Discord, or reach out directly, that's what shapes what we build. Every suggestion, bug report, and feature request matters to us. Thank you for that.

So as we kick off 2026, we want to ask: **What should we ship next?**

Got a feature you're waiting for? A bug that's causing you trouble? An idea that would take things to the next level for you? We want to hear it.

**Share your thoughts:**

Thanks for being part of this journey with us. Let's build great things together in 2026! 🚀
