title: Enable Neon Auth in Vercel, Backup & Restore enhancements, and more
---

## Enable Neon Auth in Vercel

You can now enable [Neon Auth](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-auth) directly from the [Neon Postgres Integration on Vercel](https://vercel.com/marketplace/neon). Enable it when creating a database, or later by going to the **Storage** tab in Vercel, selecting your database, and updating the **Settings**.

Neon Auth makes it easy to add authentication to your app. User data is stored in your Neon Postgres database, so you can query it like any other table — and join it with your app data.  
Learn more in the [Neon Auth guide](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/neon-auth).

## Backup & Restore enhancements

The **Backup & Restore** page (available in [Early Access](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings#early-access)) includes two updates:

- The **Instant point-in-time restore** selector now defaults to the current time, making it easier to restore to the present or a recent point in time.

- You can now edit the snapshot name — an improvement based on feedback from our Early Access users.

<details>

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon MCP Server**

  - The `list_projects` and `create_project` MCP tools now return Neon organization details.

- **Neon API**

  - Updated the [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) API description to make it clear that the API creates a branch without a compute endpoint by default. To create a branch with a compute endpoint, the endpoint object must be added to the request body.
  - Expanded the General Error description in our API specification to clarify when it’s safe to retry a failed request based on the HTTP method and response.

- **Neon Postgres Integration on Vercel**

  - When you connect a Vercel project to a Neon database, the integration now sets a `NEON_PROJECT_ID` environment variable in Vercel. This variable will support a new SaaS starter kit, which we'll introduce soon!

- **Usage notification emails**

  - We've updated usage notification emails to include the account or org name they apply to. Helpful if you're part of more than one org — you'll know exactly where the alert is coming from.

- **Fixes**

  - Fixed an issue that prevented creating more than one read replica on the Free plan, which supports up to three read replicas.
  - Fixed an issue with a [pgrag](/docs/extensions/pgrag) extension function. A query using the `rag_bge_small_en_v15.embedding_for_passage` function failed to complete.
  - Fixed an issue where reaching the `max_client_conn` limit in PgBouncer could cause the connection info cache to be invalidated. This led to repeated attempts to wake the compute.
  - Removed a redundant **Close** button from the **Connect to your database** modal.
