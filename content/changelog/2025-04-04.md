## Neon MCP Server in the cloud

Weâ€™ve brought the [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/mcp-server-neon) to the cloud. Our hosted MCP server makes it easier to integrate AI workflows into clients like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktopâ€”no API keys or local setup required.

You can start using it today by pointing your client to:

```text
https://mcp.neon.tech
```

**How to try it with Cursor:**

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Under **MCP Servers**, add:

   ```ini
   "Neon": {
     "command": "npx",
     "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.neon.tech/sse"]
   }
   ```

Thatâ€™s itâ€”youâ€™re connected to Neonâ€™s remote MCP Server.

Weâ€™re releasing this in **preview** while the MCP OAuth spec continues to evolve. Things might change, and weâ€™d love your feedback as we improve.

## New safeguards for protected branches

We added a warning and confirmation modal to the **SQL Editor** when running queries on [protected branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches). This helps prevent accidental changes to production data. You'll see a clear notice and must confirm before proceeding.

## Create Neon projects directly from the Azure Portal

For users of Neon on Azure â€” you can now create Neon projects directly from the Azure Portal. Creating a project is part of Neon Serverless Postgres resource creation. You can also add Neon projects to an existing Neon resource from a new **Projects** page. All Neon plans, including the Free plan, support creating multiple Neon projects.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon Console**

  The **Computes** tab on individual branch pages in the Neon Console now shows **Started** and **Suspended** labels for the primary compute, indicating when the compute was last started or suspended.

- **Neon API**

  We added a `started_at` attribute to the [Retrieve compute endpoint details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getprojectendpoint) response. This timestamp shows when your Neon compute was last started.

- **Vercel Native Integration**

  New Neon projects (referred to as _Databases_ in Vercel) now use Postgres 17 by default. Previously, projects created through the [Vercel Native Integration](/docs/guides/vercel-native-integration) used Postgres 15.

- **Neon App for Slack**

  We've added a new `/neon disconnect` command to the **Neon App for Slack**. This command lets you remove your Neon account connection and unsubscribe from all channels while keeping the app installed for future use. You can use it when you need to switch accounts or temporarily pause notifications.

  As a reminder, you can use `/neon subscribe` in any channel to start receiving notifications again. The bot will guide you through any necessary setup steps.

  To install the app or learn more about all available commands, see [Neon App for Slack](/docs/manage/slack-app).

- **Fixes**

  Fixed an issue that caused the **Tables** page in the Neon Console to reload when the browser page regained focus.
