### Fixes & improvements

- API: An operation was added to the [Update project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) API response. An `apply_storage_config` operation is now returned when updating the `history_retention_seconds` value. If your application uses this API to modify the `history_retention_seconds` value and expects a specific response, you may need to make code adjustments.
  Read more about operations here: [Operations](/docs/manage/operations).

### Fixes & improvements

- Proxy: Enabled channel binding in the Neon proxy, which is an additional security measure that ties the authentication process (using SCRAM) to the specific secure communication channel, protecting it from advanced types of cyberattacks where the attacker is able to intercept and mimic secure communication channels.
