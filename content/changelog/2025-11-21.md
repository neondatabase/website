## Neon status page migration to a new provider

We've recently migrated [neonstatus.com](https://neonstatus.com/) to a new provider. The migration improves reliability and performance while keeping the same familiar domain. All historical incident data has been preserved, and no action is required from users.

## Postgres extension updates

We've expanded extension support for Postgres 18.

**Now available on Postgres 18:**

| Extension | Version |
| :-------- | :------ |
| rum       | 1.3     |

The [rum](https://github.com/postgrespro/rum) extension provides advanced full-text search capabilities with additional features beyond the standard GIN index. This update brings Postgres 18 support with version 1.3.15.

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.2.9. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Data API custom types creation issue**

  Fixed an issue where PostgreSQL custom types (such as ENUMs) containing capital letters in their names were not handled correctly. Custom types like `CREATE TYPE "public"."LeadOrigin" AS ENUM (...)` now work as expected.

- **plcoffee and plls extensions**

  The `plcoffee` and `plls` extensions are no longer available on Postgres 17 and 18 due to installation issues. These extensions remain supported on Postgres 14, 15, and 16.
