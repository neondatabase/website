title: 50 projects on the Free plan, branch anonymization APIs, and more

## More projects on the Free plan

We've increased the Free plan project limit again! The Neon Free plan now includes:

- ~~30 projects~~
- **50 projects**

This gives you even more room for side projects, prototypes, experiments, and learning new stacks.

This change applies automatically to all Free plan users—no action required. For more information about plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Branch anonymization APIs

Last week, we announced [Data masking](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization) for creating anonymized branches (see the [November 14 changelog](/docs/changelog/2025-11-14)). This week, you'll find the APIs for this feature available in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api):

- [Create anonymized branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchanonymized)
- [Get masking rules](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getmaskingrules)
- [Update masking rules](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updatemaskingrules)
- [Start anonymization](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startanonymization)
- [Get anonymization status](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getanonymizedbranchstatus)

For usage examples and request/response details, see [Data anonymization APIs](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization#data-anonymization-apis).

## Neon status page migration

We've recently migrated [neonstatus.com](https://neonstatus.com/) to a new provider. The migration improves reliability and performance while keeping the same familiar domain. All historical incident data has been preserved, and no action is required from users.

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Data masking page improvements**
  - The **Apply masking rules** button is now disabled when no masking rules have been changed, preventing unnecessary reapplication of rules.
  - Added placeholder text to the search field on the Data Masking page to clarify that it searches for columns to anonymize.

- **API parameter deprecation**
  - A redundant `name` query parameter in the [Restore snapshot](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/restoresnapshot) API endpoint has been deprecated. Use the `name` field in the request body instead. The deprecated parameter will be removed on November 29, 2025.

- **Drizzle Studio update**
  - The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.2.9. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Fixes**
  - The **Restore branch from** modal that you see before completing a restore operation now only shows an expiration date extension message for branches that have an expiration date set. Previously, the message was shown for all branches, even those without an expiration date.
  - Fixed an issue where timestamps shown on the **Restore branch from** modal were formatted inconsistently, alternating between UTC and local timezone. Timestamps now consistently display in your local timezone.
  - For the Neon Data API, we fixed an issue where PostgreSQL custom types (such as ENUMs) containing capital letters in their names were not handled correctly.
