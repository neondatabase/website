## Neon status page migration to a new provider

We've recently migrated [neonstatus.com](https://neonstatus.com/) to a new provider. The migration improves reliability and performance while keeping the same familiar domain. All historical incident data has been preserved, and no action is required from users.

## Postgres extension updates

We've expanded extension support for Postgres 18.

**Now available on Postgres 18:**

| Extension | Version |
| :-------- | :------ |
| rum       | 1.3     |

The [rum](https://github.com/postgrespro/rum) extension provides advanced full-text search capabilities with additional features beyond the standard GIN index. This update brings Postgres 18 support with version 1.3.15.

For a complete list of Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see [Postgres extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

## Branch anonymization APIs in API reference

Last week, we announced [Data masking](/docs/workflows/data-anonymization) for creating anonymized branches (see the [November 14 changelog](/docs/changelog/2025-11-14)). This week, you'll find the APIs for this feature documented in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api):

- [Create anonymized branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchanonymized)
- [Get masking rules](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getmaskingrules)
- [Update masking rules](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updatemaskingrules)
- [Start anonymization](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startanonymization)
- [Get anonymization status](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getanonymizedstatus)

<details>
<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Drizzle Studio update**

  The Drizzle Studio integration that powers the **Tables** page in the Neon Console has been updated to version 1.2.9. For the latest improvements and fixes, see the [Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-drizzle-studio-changelog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

- **Data API custom types creation issue**

  Fixed an issue where PostgreSQL custom types (such as ENUMs) containing capital letters in their names were not handled correctly. Custom types like `CREATE TYPE "public"."LeadOrigin" AS ENUM (...)` now work as expected.

- **Branch restore modal expiration message**

  The Restore branch from modal that is displays before you complete a restore operation now only shows an expiration date extension message for branches that have an expiration date set. Previously, the message was shown for all branches, even those without an expiration date.

- **Restore snapshot API parameter deprecation**

  A redundant `name` query parameter in the [Restore snapshot](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/restoresnapshot) API endpoint has been deprecated. Use the `name` field in the request body instead. The deprecated parameter will be removed on November 29, 2025.

- **Consistent timestamp display in branch restore modal**

  Fixed an issue where timestamps in the branch restore modal were formatted inconsistently, alternating between UTC and local timezone. Timestamps now consistently display in your local timezone.

- **Data Masking page improvements**
  - The **Apply masking rules** button is now disabled when no masking rules have been changed, preventing unnecessary reapplication of rules.
  - Added placeholder text to the search field on the Data Masking page to clarify that it searches for columns to anonymize.

- **Backup schedule validation**

  The backup schedule dialog now displays validation errors for the snapshot retention period field when invalid values are entered (for example, "Max up to 35" when exceeding the maximum retention period).
