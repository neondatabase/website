### Autoscaling is now GA

![visualization for autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling_intro.png)

In case you missed the [announcement](https://neon.tech/blog/neon-autoscaling-is-generally-available) earlier this week, we're excited to share that Neon's Autoscaling feature is now generally available. Autoscaling has been a core objective for Neon from the very beginning. With Autoscaling, your database automatically adjusts its compute resources up or down based on demand, including scaling down to zero when not in use. This feature is now ready for production, making it easier than ever to manage workloads efficiently.

If you're not yet familiar with Neon's Autoscaling feature, you can learn more here:

- [An introduction to Neon's Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/autoscaling)
- [Understanding Neon's Autoscaling algorithm](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-algorithm)
- [Enabling Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide)

### Autoscaling on the Free Plan

In addition to our Autoscaling GA announcement, we've made Autoscaling available on our [Free Plan](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan), where you can automatically scale computes from 0.25 vCPU with 1 GB of RAM up to 2 vCPU with 8 GB of RAM. To learn how, see [Enabling Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide).

When you try Autoscaling on the Free Plan, we recommend [monitoring your monthly compute hour allowance](/docs/introduction/monitor-usage). A compute that scales up regularly to meet demand will consume your compute hour allowance more quickly.

### Postgres version updates

Supported Postgres versions were updated to [14.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.13/), [15.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.8/), and [16.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.4/), respectively.

### Upcoming change for branch reset and restore from protected branches

This new protected branches feature is not coming until next week, but we wanted to give you a heads-up in case you need to make any adjustments to your CI scripts or workflows: When you reset or restore a child branch from a protected parent branch, new passwords will be generated for the Postgres roles on the child branch.

This behavior is designed to prevent the exposure of passwords that could be used to access your protected branch. For example, if you designate a production branch as protected, the newly generated passwords for Postgres roles on child branches ensure that you're not exposing product branch credentials in your development and test environments.

The protected branches feature is available with the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan. To learn more, refer to our [Protected branches guide](/docs/guides/protected-branches).

<Admonition type="note">
If your CI scripts create branches from protected branches, please be aware that passwords for Postgres roles on those newly created branches will now differ. If you depend on those passwords being the same, you'll need to make adjustments to get the correct connection details for those branches. For more, refer to our [Protected branches guide](/docs/guides/protected-branches).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- The [Reset a Neon branch](https://github.com/neondatabase/reset-branch-action) GitHub Action, which resets a child branch with the latest data from its parent, now outputs connection string values. New outputs include:
  - `branch_id`: The ID of the newly reset branch.
  - `db_url`: The database connection string for the branch after the reset.
  - `db_url_with_pooler`: The pooled database connection string for the branch after the reset.
  - `host`: The branch host after the reset.
  - `host_with_pooler`: The branch host with the connection pooling option after the reset.
  - `password`: The Postgres role password for connecting to the branch database after the reset.
- We've revamped the **Usage** widget on the Project Dashboard for Free Plan users, making it easier to monitor your usage allowances. Now prominently positioned at the top of the dashboard, the **Usage** widget provides an at-a-glance view of your monthly totals for Storage, Compute, Branch compute, and Branches. For an overview of Neon Free Plan allowances, please see [Free Plan](/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan).
- Fixed an issue with the Neon CLI's `neonctl -v` command. The command returned `unknown` instead of the CLI version number. Thanks to community member [@mrl5](https://github.com/mrl5) for the contribution.
- Fixed an issue with the Neon Docs site navigation. Thanks to community member [@lemorage](https://github.com/lemorage) for the contribution.
