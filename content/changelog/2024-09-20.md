### Neon Organizations now in Public Beta

We're happy to announce that the Neon **Organizations** feature is now available in Public Beta.

![get started with your new org](/docs/manage/org_projects.png)

Create a new organization, transfer over your projects, invite your team members and get started collaborating. The Organizations feature lets you manage all of your team's projects under a single account â€” with billing, role management, and project transfer capabilities in one accessible location.

See [Neon Organizations](/docs/manage/organizations) to get started. Organizations is a paid account feature.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- We added a **Protect** button to the default branch **Overview** page to make it easier to enable branch protection. The [Protected Branches](/docs/guides/protected-branches) feature is available with the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) and [Business](/docs/introduction/plans#business) plans.

- The **Created by** column on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console now displays the creation source for branches created via GitHub or the [Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel#add-the-neon-vercel-integration). Hovering over the creation source will trigger a pop-up that provides links to an associated preview, repository, or code branch, where applicable.

- Starting next week, we will start enforcing a limit of 500 roles and 500 databases per branch. If you have any concerns about these new limits, please reach out to the Neon Support team. Previously, these limits were recommended but not enforced.
- We now support self-serve account deletion should you need to remove your Neon account for any reason. See [Delete your account](/docs/manage/accounts#delete-your-account) for details.
