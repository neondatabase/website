### Improvements and fixes

- API: Updated the `region_id` description in the Project API to include a link to the list of regions supported by Neon.
- UI: Revised the style of the **Unsubscribe** dialog accessed from the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.
- UI: Updated the metric units in the **Usage** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**
- UI: Fixed an issue that prevented **Usage** widget metrics on the Neon **Dashboard** from displaying data as expected. The API that supports the widget did not provide the required data.
- UI: Fixed an issue that caused Free Tier usage to be included in metrics data displayed in the **Usage** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** after upgrading to the Neon Pro plan. This issue did not affect billing.
