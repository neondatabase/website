### Improvements and fixes

- API: Removed the `physical_size` property from the Branch response body in the Neon API.
- Control Plane: Addressed a memory leak that affected Neon Console performance. A memory limit was put in place prevent similar issues.
- UI: Changed the **User** label on the **Connection Details** widget to **Roles**. Database users are now referred to as **Roles** in Neon.
- UI: Added descriptive text and a documentation link to the **Integrations** page in the Neon Console.
- UI: Added support for sharing projects with other Neon users. Project sharing is performed from the **Settings** page in the Neon Console. The project sharing feature is available only to Neon paid plan users, but projects can be shared with any Neon user, including Free Tier users. For instructions, see [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects).
- UI: Added an **Upgrade to Pro** option to the Neon Console to enable upgrading from Free Tier to Neon's Pro plan. For information about Neon's paid plans, please refer to [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).
- UI: Fixed the connection examples accessible from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Examples other than the `psql` example had an extra project name in the connection hostname.
- UI: Fixed the "Manage" link on the **Branches** widget on the Neon Dashboard. The link did not work.
