### Support for custom-built Postgres extensions

Neon now supports custom-built Postgres extensions for exclusive use with your Neon account. If you developed your own Postgres extension and want to use it with Neon, send a request to [support@neon.tech](mailto:support@neon.tech). For more information, see [Custom-built extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#custom-built-extensions).
