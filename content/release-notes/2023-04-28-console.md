### What's new

- API: Enabled checking for the Neon API specification to ensure that examples are updated when the specification is modified.
- API: Added a `history_retention_seconds` property to the [Project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getproject) response body. Neon retains a 7-day history to support point-in-time restore. History retention will become a configurable parameter in a future release.
- API: Increased the maximum value of the `suspend_timeout_seconds` property in the [Endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getprojectendpoint) API from 86400 seconds (1 day) to 604800 seconds (7 days). This change affects the maximum **Auto-suspend delay** setting that Neon Pro plan users can configure when creating or editing a compute endpoint. The **Auto-suspend delay** setting defines the number of seconds of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes). For more information, see [Auto-suspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration).
- UI: Redesigned the branch details page in the Neon Console. In addition to the information displayed previously, the page now provide usage metrics, including **Active time**, **Compute time**, **Written data**, and **Data transfer**. This information enables you to monitor usage for individual branches. Refer to our [Billing](/docs/introduction/billing) page for information about the usage metrics.

  The compute endpoint information on the branch details page has also been expanded to include **Compute size**, **Auto-suspend delay**, and **Last active** information. **Compute size (min)** and **Compute size (max)** values are shown for computes with the [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling) feature enabled. For information about these values, see [View a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#view-a-compute-endpoint).

- UI: Added an **Active time** column to the table on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. This column shows the number of hours the branch compute endpoint has been active for the current month.
- UI: The **Connection Details** dialog displayed when creating a project or a branch now provides **Pooled connection** and **Direct connection** tabs, allowing you to copy a pooled or direct connection string for the default `neondb` database.

  For information about connection pooling in Neon, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).
- UI: Updated the `prisma.js` code example accessible from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. The connection string now includes a `connect_timeout` parameter to prevent Prisma from timing out due to cold starts, and a `pgbouncer=true` parameter, which is required when using Prisma with a pooled connection string. For more information about using Neon with Prisma, see [Connect Neon to Prisma](/docs/guides/prisma).
- Control Plane: Added a constraint to ensure that the maximum _Autoscaling_ compute size is greater than or equal to the minimum compute size.
- UI: Added icons and hover help to the **Usage** widget on the Neon Console.
