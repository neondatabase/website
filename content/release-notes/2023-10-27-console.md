### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Added a consent checkbox to the **Create Support Ticket** modal available via the **Support** link in the Neon Console sidebar. By ticking the checkbox, users grant Neon employees permission to connect to their databases for support purposes. This streamlines the troubleshooting process, ensuring quicker resolutions.
- UI: You can now edit the **First name** and **Last name** fields on the **Profile** settings page for your Neon account. You can access your profile settings by clicking your avatar at the bottom left corner of the Neon Console and selecting **Profile**.
