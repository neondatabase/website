### Improvements and fixes

- UI: The Neon SQL Editor now maintains a history of previously executed queries and permits saving queries. For more information about these capabilities, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/).
- UI: Added token-based authorization to [Neon's public API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
- UI: Changed the display status of operations waiting in the queue from `In progress` to `Scheduling`.
- UI: Disabled controls that incorrectly remained enabled while the Neon project was in a transitive state.
- Control Plane: Set `max_replication_write_lag` to `15 MB` to tune the backpressure mechanism and improve PostgresSQL responsiveness under load.
- Control Plane: Improved the ability to investigate performance issues by collecting and saving more detailed compute node startup time metrics.
- UI: Fixed incorrect encoding when switching between code samples in the **Connection Details** widget on the project Dashboard, and added descriptions to connection string examples.
- UI: Fixed various typos and errors.
