### Improved connection snippets

We streamlined the connection snippets in the [Connection Details](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app) panel for better usability:
- A new eye icon lets you toggle password visbility within all connection snippets. Note that this feature is for visual display only; copied snippets always include the password.
- All connection snippets now include <code>sslmode=require</code>, enabling encryption by default.

These changes apply wherever the Connection Details pane appears: on the Dashboard page, when you create a branch, and when you create a project.
