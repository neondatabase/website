### Improvements and fixes

- API: Added a `branch` object to the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) endpoint that allows you to specify names for the primary branch, role, and database created with a project. Previously, specifying non-default names for these objects required additional API calls after creating a project.
- API: Updated the [List project consumption](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectsconsumption) endpoint description to indicate that the pagination maximum is 1000.
- Control Plane: Added an option to enable a foreground deletion policy for Kubernetes clusters, which blocks other operations until cascading resource deletions are finished. The foreground option reduces the amount of polling for operation completion.
- Control Plane: Added the ability to search for branches in S3 storage, enabling identification of branches in storage that have already been deleted in the console.
- Control Plane: Simplified SQL logging to reduce the amount of log write processing.
