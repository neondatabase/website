### Fixes & improvements

- API: Adjusted the tags in the Neon API specification that assign endpoints to categories. The new [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) displays one endpoint per page. Multiple tags assigned to an endpoint resulted in endpoints not being listed under their primary category.
- UI: Updated the labels, links, and units shown on the **Project limits** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.
- UI: Fixed the vertical alignment of buttons on authorization dialogs.
- UI: Removed a newline character from the connection string in the connection details dialog that is displayed after creating a new project.
