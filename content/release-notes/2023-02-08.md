### What's new

- UI: Updated various UI elements in the Neon Console to rename **Endpoints** to **Computes**. The term _Endpoint_ was not specific enough to accurately reflect the resource being referred to. A **Compute** in Neon refers the compute instance that runs PostgreSQL.
- UI: Added a `PRIMARY` badge to identify the primary branch of a Neon project. The badge is visible on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console and in other UI elements that show a project's branches.
