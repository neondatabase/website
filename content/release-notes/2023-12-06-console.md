description: Change to the Update project API response

### Fixes & improvements

- API: An [operation](/docs/manage/operations) was added to the [Update project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) API response. An `apply_storage_config` operation is now returned when updating the `history_retention_seconds` value. If your application uses this API to modify the `history_retention_seconds` value and expects a specific response, you may need to make code adjustments.
