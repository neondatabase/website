## Chapter 16. Installation from Binaries

PostgreSQL is available in the form of binary packages for most common operating systems today. When available, this is the recommended way to install PostgreSQL for users of the system. Building from source (see [Chapter 17](installation)) is only recommended for people developing PostgreSQL or extensions.

For an updated list of platforms providing binary packages, please visit the download section on the PostgreSQL website at [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and follow the instructions for the specific platform.
