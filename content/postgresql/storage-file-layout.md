## 73.1. Database File Layout [#](#STORAGE-FILE-LAYOUT)

This section describes the storage format at the level of files and directories.

Traditionally, the configuration and data files used by a database cluster are stored together within the cluster's data directory, commonly referred to as `PGDATA` (after the name of the environment variable that can be used to define it). A common location for `PGDATA` is `/var/lib/pgsql/data`. Multiple clusters, managed by different server instances, can exist on the same machine.

The `PGDATA` directory contains several subdirectories and control files, as shown in [Table 73.1](storage-file-layout#PGDATA-CONTENTS-TABLE). In addition to these required items, the cluster configuration files `postgresql.conf`, `pg_hba.conf`, and `pg_ident.conf` are traditionally stored in `PGDATA`, although it is possible to place them elsewhere.

| Item                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `postmaster.pid`       | A lock file recording the current postmaster process ID (PID), cluster data directory path, postmaster start timestamp, port number, Unix-domain socket directory path (could be empty), first valid listen_address (IP address or `*`, or empty if not listening on TCP), and shared memory segment ID (this file is not present after server shutdown) |

For each database in the cluster there is a subdirectory within `PGDATA``/base`, named after the database's OID in `pg_database`. This subdirectory is the default location for the database's files; in particular, its system catalogs are stored there.

Note that the following sections describe the behavior of the builtin `heap` [table access method](tableam), and the builtin [index access methods](indexam). Due to the extensible nature of PostgreSQL, other access methods might work differently.

Each table and index is stored in a separate file. For ordinary relations, these files are named after the table or index's _filenode_ number, which can be found in `pg_class`.`relfilenode`. But for temporary relations, the file name is of the form `tBBB_FFF`, where _`BBB`_ is the backend ID of the backend which created the file, and _`FFF`_ is the filenode number. In either case, in addition to the main file (a/k/a main fork), each table and index has a _free space map_ (see [Section 73.3](storage-fsm)), which stores information about free space available in the relation. The free space map is stored in a file named with the filenode number plus the suffix `_fsm`. Tables also have a _visibility map_, stored in a fork with the suffix `_vm`, to track which pages are known to have no dead tuples. The visibility map is described further in [Section 73.4](storage-vm). Unlogged tables and indexes have a third fork, known as the initialization fork, which is stored in a fork with the suffix `_init` (see [Section 73.5](storage-init)).

### Caution

Note that while a table's filenode often matches its OID, this is _not_ necessarily the case; some operations, like `TRUNCATE`, `REINDEX`, `CLUSTER` and some forms of `ALTER TABLE`, can change the filenode while preserving the OID. Avoid assuming that filenode and table OID are the same. Also, for certain system catalogs including `pg_class` itself, `pg_class`.`relfilenode` contains zero. The actual filenode number of these catalogs is stored in a lower-level data structure, and can be obtained using the `pg_relation_filenode()` function.

When a table or index exceeds 1 GB, it is divided into gigabyte-sized _segments_. The first segment's file name is the same as the filenode; subsequent segments are named filenode.1, filenode.2, etc. This arrangement avoids problems on platforms that have file size limitations. (Actually, 1 GB is just the default segment size. The segment size can be adjusted using the configuration option `--with-segsize` when building PostgreSQL.) In principle, free space map and visibility map forks could require multiple segments as well, though this is unlikely to happen in practice.

A table that has columns with potentially large entries will have an associated _TOAST_ table, which is used for out-of-line storage of field values that are too large to keep in the table rows proper. `pg_class`.`reltoastrelid` links from a table to its TOAST table, if any. See [Section 73.2](storage-toast) for more information.

The contents of tables and indexes are discussed further in [Section 73.6](storage-page-layout).

Tablespaces make the scenario more complicated. Each user-defined tablespace has a symbolic link inside the `PGDATA``/pg_tblspc` directory, which points to the physical tablespace directory (i.e., the location specified in the tablespace's `CREATE TABLESPACE` command). This symbolic link is named after the tablespace's OID. Inside the physical tablespace directory there is a subdirectory with a name that depends on the PostgreSQL server version, such as `PG_9.0_201008051`. (The reason for using this subdirectory is so that successive versions of the database can use the same `CREATE TABLESPACE` location value without conflicts.) Within the version-specific subdirectory, there is a subdirectory for each database that has elements in the tablespace, named after the database's OID. Tables and indexes are stored within that directory, using the filenode naming scheme. The `pg_default` tablespace is not accessed through `pg_tblspc`, but corresponds to `PGDATA``/base`. Similarly, the `pg_global` tablespace is not accessed through `pg_tblspc`, but corresponds to `PGDATA``/global`.

The `pg_relation_filepath()` function shows the entire path (relative to `PGDATA`) of any relation. It is often useful as a substitute for remembering many of the above rules. But keep in mind that this function just gives the name of the first segment of the main fork of the relation — you may need to append a segment number and/or `_fsm`, `_vm`, or `_init` to find all the files associated with the relation.

Temporary files (for operations such as sorting more data than can fit in memory) are created within `PGDATA``/base/pgsql_tmp`, or within a `pgsql_tmp` subdirectory of a tablespace directory if a tablespace other than `pg_default` is specified for them. The name of a temporary file has the form `pgsql_tmpPPP.NNN`, where _`PPP`_ is the PID of the owning backend and _`NNN`_ distinguishes different temporary files of that backend.
