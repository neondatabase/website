## 53.51. `pg_statistic` [#](#CATALOG-PG-STATISTIC)

The catalog `pg_statistic` stores statistical data about the contents of the database. Entries are created by [`ANALYZE`](sql-analyze) and subsequently used by the query planner. Note that all the statistical data is inherently approximate, even assuming that it is up-to-date.

Normally there is one entry, with `stainherit` = `false`, for each table column that has been analyzed. If the table has inheritance children or partitions, a second entry with `stainherit` = `true` is also created. This row represents the column's statistics over the inheritance tree, i.e., statistics for the data you'd see with `SELECT column FROM table*`, whereas the `stainherit` = `false` row represents the results of `SELECT column FROM ONLY table`.

`pg_statistic` also stores statistical data about the values of index expressions. These are described as if they were actual data columns; in particular, `starelid` references the index. No entry is made for an ordinary non-expression index column, however, since it would be redundant with the entry for the underlying table column. Currently, entries for index expressions always have `stainherit` = `false`.

Since different kinds of statistics might be appropriate for different kinds of data, `pg_statistic` is designed not to assume very much about what sort of statistics it stores. Only extremely general statistics (such as nullness) are given dedicated columns in `pg_statistic`. Everything else is stored in “slots”, which are groups of associated columns whose content is identified by a code number in one of the slot's columns. For more information see `src/include/catalog/pg_statistic.h`.

`pg_statistic` should not be readable by the public, since even statistical information about a table's contents might be considered sensitive. (Example: minimum and maximum values of a salary column might be quite interesting.) [`pg_stats`](view-pg-stats) is a publicly readable view on `pg_statistic` that only exposes information about those tables that are readable by the current user.

| `starelid` `oid` (references [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class).`oid`)The table or index that the described column belongs to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `stainherit` `bool`If true, the stats include values from child tables, not just the values in the specified relation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `stanullfrac` `float4`The fraction of the column's entries that are null                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `stawidth` `int4`The average stored width, in bytes, of nonnull entries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `stadistinct` `float4`The number of distinct nonnull data values in the column. A value greater than zero is the actual number of distinct values. A value less than zero is the negative of a multiplier for the number of rows in the table; for example, a column in which about 80% of the values are nonnull and each nonnull value appears about twice on average could be represented by `stadistinct` = -0.4. A zero value means the number of distinct values is unknown. |
| `stakindN` `int2`A code number indicating the kind of statistics stored in the *`N`*th “slot” of the `pg_statistic` row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `staopN` `oid` (references [`pg_operator`](catalog-pg-operator).`oid`)An operator used to derive the statistics stored in the *`N`*th “slot”. For example, a histogram slot would show the `<` operator that defines the sort order of the data. Zero if the statistics kind does not require an operator.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `stacollN` `oid` (references [`pg_collation`](catalog-pg-collation).`oid`)The collation used to derive the statistics stored in the *`N`*th “slot”. For example, a histogram slot for a collatable column would show the collation that defines the sort order of the data. Zero for noncollatable data.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `stanumbersN` `float4[]`Numerical statistics of the appropriate kind for the *`N`*th “slot”, or null if the slot kind does not involve numerical values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `stavaluesN` `anyarray`Column data values of the appropriate kind for the *`N`*th “slot”, or null if the slot kind does not store any data values. Each array's element values are actually of the specific column's data type, or a related type such as an array's element type, so there is no way to define these columns' type more specifically than `anyarray`.                                                                                                             |
