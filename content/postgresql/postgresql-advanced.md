The **PostgreSQL Advanced** section covers sophisticated PostgreSQL features and techniques for building enterprise-level applications. These advanced topics will help you optimize performance, implement complex business logic, and leverage PostgreSQL's powerful capabilities for modern application development.

## Section 1. Advanced Database Programming

Learn advanced PostgreSQL programming concepts including stored procedures, triggers, and complex data manipulation techniques that enable sophisticated database-driven applications.

- [PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL](postgresql-plpgsql) – learn PostgreSQL's procedural language for creating stored procedures, functions, and complex database logic with powerful programming constructs for sophisticated database applications.
- [PostgreSQL Triggers](postgresql-triggers) – automate database operations with triggers that execute automatically when data changes, implementing complex business rules and maintaining data integrity.
- [PostgreSQL Views](postgresql-views) – create virtual tables and materialized views to simplify complex queries, improve performance, and provide secure data access patterns for your applications.

## Section 2. Performance and Optimization

Advanced techniques for optimizing PostgreSQL performance, managing large datasets, and implementing efficient data access patterns.

- [PostgreSQL Indexes](postgresql-indexes) – learn database indexing strategies to dramatically improve query performance with different index types and optimization techniques.
- [PostgreSQL JSON Functions](postgresql-json-functions) – learn PostgreSQL's JSON functions for working with JSON and JSONB data types, essential for modern applications handling semi-structured data and API integrations.
- [PostgreSQL Window Functions](postgresql-window-function) – perform advanced analytical calculations across sets of rows using ranking functions, lead/lag functions, and window frame specifications for sophisticated data analysis.

Each section provides comprehensive tutorials with practical examples that demonstrate real-world applications of these advanced PostgreSQL capabilities.
