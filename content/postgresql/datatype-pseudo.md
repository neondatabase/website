## 8.21. Pseudo-Types [#](#DATATYPE-PSEUDO)

The PostgreSQL type system contains a number of special-purpose entries that are collectively called _pseudo-types_. A pseudo-type cannot be used as a column data type, but it can be used to declare a function's argument or result type. Each of the available pseudo-types is useful in situations where a function's behavior does not correspond to simply taking or returning a value of a specific SQL data type. [Table 8.27](datatype-pseudo#DATATYPE-PSEUDOTYPES-TABLE) lists the existing pseudo-types.

Functions coded in C (whether built-in or dynamically loaded) can be declared to accept or return any of these pseudo-types. It is up to the function author to ensure that the function will behave safely when a pseudo-type is used as an argument type.

Functions coded in procedural languages can use pseudo-types only as allowed by their implementation languages. At present most procedural languages forbid use of a pseudo-type as an argument type, and allow only `void` and `record` as a result type (plus `trigger` or `event_trigger` when the function is used as a trigger or event trigger). Some also support polymorphic functions using the polymorphic pseudo-types, which are shown above and discussed in detail in [Section 38.2.5](extend-type-system#EXTEND-TYPES-POLYMORPHIC).

The `internal` pseudo-type is used to declare functions that are meant only to be called internally by the database system, and not by direct invocation in an SQL query. If a function has at least one `internal`-type argument then it cannot be called from SQL. To preserve the type safety of this restriction it is important to follow this coding rule: do not create any function that is declared to return `internal` unless it has at least one `internal` argument.
