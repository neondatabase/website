This PostgreSQL PHP section shows you how to interact with the PostgreSQL database using [PHP Data Objects](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) (PDO) API. It guides you through the steps of performing the common database operations in PHP, including creating new tables, inserting data, updating data, querying data, deleting data, using transactions, calling stored procedures, and handling binary large objects.

PHP is a highly popular scripting language for developing web applications and websites. PHP is fast, flexible, and easy to learn. It powers everything from a personal blog to complex e\-commerce platforms, making it a powerful tool for web development.

The PHP Data Objects (PDO) defines a unified interface for accessing relational databases in PHP. Each database defines the database\-specific driver that implements the PDO interface. Additionally, each driver can expose the database\-specific features as regular extension functions.

Many PHP distributions include the `PDO_PGSQL` driver that allows you to interact with PostgreSQL databases through the PDO API.
