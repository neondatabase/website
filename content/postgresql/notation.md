## 3. Conventions [#](#NOTATION)

The following conventions are used in the synopsis of a command: brackets (`[` and `]`) indicate optional parts. Braces (`{` and `}`) and vertical lines (`|`) indicate that you must choose one alternative. Dots (`...`) mean that the preceding element can be repeated. All other symbols, including parentheses, should be taken literally.

Where it enhances the clarity, SQL commands are preceded by the prompt `=>`, and shell commands are preceded by the prompt `$`. Normally, prompts are not shown, though.

An _administrator_ is generally a person who is in charge of installing and running the server. A _user_ could be anyone who is using, or wants to use, any part of the PostgreSQL system. These terms should not be interpreted too narrowly; this book does not have fixed presumptions about system administration procedures.
