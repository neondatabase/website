## ROLLBACK

ROLLBACK — abort the current transaction

## Synopsis

```

ROLLBACK [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ AND [ NO ] CHAIN ]
```

## Description

`ROLLBACK` rolls back the current transaction and causes all the updates made by the transaction to be discarded.

## Parameters

* `WORK``TRANSACTION` [#](#SQL-ROLLBACK-TRANSACTION)

    Optional key words. They have no effect.

* `AND CHAIN` [#](#SQL-ROLLBACK-CHAIN)

    If `AND CHAIN` is specified, a new (not aborted) transaction is immediately started with the same transaction characteristics (see [SET TRANSACTION](sql-set-transaction.html "SET TRANSACTION")) as the just finished one. Otherwise, no new transaction is started.

## Notes

Use [`COMMIT`](sql-commit.html "COMMIT") to successfully terminate a transaction.

Issuing `ROLLBACK` outside of a transaction block emits a warning and otherwise has no effect. `ROLLBACK AND CHAIN` outside of a transaction block is an error.

## Examples

To abort all changes:

```

ROLLBACK;
```

## Compatibility

The command `ROLLBACK` conforms to the SQL standard. The form `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` is a PostgreSQL extension.
