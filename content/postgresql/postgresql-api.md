The **PostgreSQL API** section covers how to interact with PostgreSQL databases from various programming languages. Each language has its own database driver and API that provides a standardized way to connect to, query, and manipulate data in PostgreSQL databases.

Whether you're building web applications, desktop software, or data processing scripts, these tutorials will help you integrate PostgreSQL seamlessly into your development workflow.

## Section 1. Programming Language Integrations

PostgreSQL provides robust support for multiple programming languages through various database drivers and APIs. Each integration offers unique features and follows language-specific best practices.

- [PostgreSQL C#](postgresql-csharp) – learn how to interact with PostgreSQL from C# applications using ADO.NET and the Npgsql .NET Data Provider, covering database connections, CRUD operations, transactions, and stored procedures.
- [PostgreSQL JDBC](postgresql-jdbc) – connect to PostgreSQL from Java applications using the PostgreSQL JDBC driver, covering the complete Java database connectivity workflow from setup to advanced operations.
- [PostgreSQL PHP](postgresql-php) – access PostgreSQL databases from PHP applications using PDO (PHP Data Objects), covering web development scenarios and best practices for PHP-PostgreSQL integration.
- [PostgreSQL Python](postgresql-python) – work with PostgreSQL from Python applications using the psycopg2 database adapter, covering everything from basic connections to advanced features like asynchronous operations and custom type handling.

Each section provides step-by-step tutorials with practical examples that you can run and modify for your own projects.
