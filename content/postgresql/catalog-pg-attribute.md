## 53.7. `pg_attribute` [#](#CATALOG-PG-ATTRIBUTE)

The catalog `pg_attribute` stores information about table columns. There will be exactly one `pg_attribute` row for every column in every table in the database. (There will also be attribute entries for indexes, and indeed all objects that have [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class) entries.)

The term attribute is equivalent to column and is used for historical reasons.

| `attrelid` `oid` (references [`pg_class`](catalog-pg-class).`oid`)The table this column belongs to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `attname` `name`The column name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `atttypid` `oid` (references [`pg_type`](catalog-pg-type).`oid`)The data type of this column (zero for a dropped column)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `attlen` `int2`A copy of `pg_type.typlen` of this column's type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `attnum` `int2`The number of the column. Ordinary columns are numbered from 1 up. System columns, such as `ctid`, have (arbitrary) negative numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `attcacheoff` `int4`Always -1 in storage, but when loaded into a row descriptor in memory this might be updated to cache the offset of the attribute within the row                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `atttypmod` `int4``atttypmod` records type-specific data supplied at table creation time (for example, the maximum length of a `varchar` column). It is passed to type-specific input functions and length coercion functions. The value will generally be -1 for types that do not need `atttypmod`.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `attndims` `int2`Number of dimensions, if the column is an array type; otherwise 0. (Presently, the number of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so any nonzero value effectively means “it's an array”.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `attbyval` `bool`A copy of `pg_type.typbyval` of this column's type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `attalign` `char`A copy of `pg_type.typalign` of this column's type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `attstorage` `char`Normally a copy of `pg_type.typstorage` of this column's type. For TOAST-able data types, this can be altered after column creation to control storage policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `attcompression` `char`The current compression method of the column. Typically this is `'\0'` to specify use of the current default setting (see [default_toast_compression](runtime-config-client#GUC-DEFAULT-TOAST-COMPRESSION)). Otherwise, `'p'` selects pglz compression, while `'l'` selects LZ4 compression. However, this field is ignored whenever `attstorage` does not allow compression.                                                                                             |
| `attnotnull` `bool`This represents a not-null constraint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `atthasdef` `bool`This column has a default expression or generation expression, in which case there will be a corresponding entry in the [`pg_attrdef`](catalog-pg-attrdef) catalog that actually defines the expression. (Check `attgenerated` to determine whether this is a default or a generation expression.)                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `atthasmissing` `bool`This column has a value which is used where the column is entirely missing from the row, as happens when a column is added with a non-volatile `DEFAULT` value after the row is created. The actual value used is stored in the `attmissingval` column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `attidentity` `char`If a zero byte (`''`), then not an identity column. Otherwise, `a` = generated always, `d` = generated by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `attgenerated` `char`If a zero byte (`''`), then not a generated column. Otherwise, `s` = stored. (Other values might be added in the future.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `attisdropped` `bool`This column has been dropped and is no longer valid. A dropped column is still physically present in the table, but is ignored by the parser and so cannot be accessed via SQL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `attislocal` `bool`This column is defined locally in the relation. Note that a column can be locally defined and inherited simultaneously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `attinhcount` `int2`The number of direct ancestors this column has. A column with a nonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `attstattarget` `int2``attstattarget` controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this column by [`ANALYZE`](sql-analyze). A zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. A negative value says to use the system default statistics target. The exact meaning of positive values is data type-dependent. For scalar data types, `attstattarget` is both the target number of “most common values” to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create. |

| `attmissingval` `anyarray`This column has a one element array containing the value used when the column is entirely missing from the row, as happens when the column is added with a non-volatile `DEFAULT` value after the row is created. The value is only used when `atthasmissing` is true. If there is no value the column is null.                                                                                                                                                        |

In a dropped column's `pg_attribute` entry, `atttypid` is reset to zero, but `attlen` and the other fields copied from [`pg_type`](catalog-pg-type) are still valid. This arrangement is needed to cope with the situation where the dropped column's data type was later dropped, and so there is no `pg_type` row anymore. `attlen` and the other fields can be used to interpret the contents of a row of the table.
