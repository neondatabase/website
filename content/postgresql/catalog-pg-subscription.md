## 53.54. `pg_subscription` [#](#CATALOG-PG-SUBSCRIPTION)

The catalog `pg_subscription` contains all existing logical replication subscriptions. For more information about logical replication see [Chapter 31](logical-replication).

Unlike most system catalogs, `pg_subscription` is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of `pg_subscription` per cluster, not one per database.

Access to the column `subconninfo` is revoked from normal users, because it could contain plain-text passwords.
