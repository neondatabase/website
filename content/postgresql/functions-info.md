| `pg_blocking_pids` ( `integer` ) → `integer[]`Returns an array of the process ID(s) of the sessions that are blocking the server process with the specified process ID from acquiring a lock, or an empty array if there is no such server process or it is not blocked.One server process blocks another if it either holds a lock that conflicts with the blocked process's lock request (hard block), or is waiting for a lock that would conflict with the blocked process's lock request and is ahead of it in the wait queue (soft block). When using parallel queries the result always lists client-visible process IDs (that is, `pg_backend_pid` results) even if the actual lock is held or awaited by a child worker process. As a result of that, there may be duplicated PIDs in the result. Also note that when a prepared transaction holds a conflicting lock, it will be represented by a zero process ID.Frequent calls to this function could have some impact on database performance, because it needs exclusive access to the lock manager's shared state for a short time. |
| `pg_conf_load_time` () → `timestamp with time zone`Returns the time when the server configuration files were last loaded. If the current session was alive at the time, this will be the time when the session itself re-read the configuration files (so the reading will vary a little in different sessions). Otherwise it is the time when the postmaster process re-read the configuration files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `pg_current_logfile` ( \[ `text` ] ) → `text`Returns the path name of the log file currently in use by the logging collector. The path includes the [log\_directory](runtime-config-logging#GUC-LOG-DIRECTORY) directory and the individual log file name. The result is `NULL` if the logging collector is disabled. When multiple log files exist, each in a different format, `pg_current_logfile` without an argument returns the path of the file having the first format found in the ordered list: `stderr`, `csvlog`, `jsonlog`. `NULL` is returned if no log file has any of these formats. To request information about a specific log file format, supply either `csvlog`, `jsonlog` or `stderr` as the value of the optional parameter. The result is `NULL` if the log format requested is not configured in [log\_destination](runtime-config-logging#GUC-LOG-DESTINATION). The result reflects the contents of the `current_logfiles` file.                                                                                                                   |

| `pg_safe_snapshot_blocking_pids` ( `integer` ) → `integer[]`Returns an array of the process ID(s) of the sessions that are blocking the server process with the specified process ID from acquiring a safe snapshot, or an empty array if there is no such server process or it is not blocked.A session running a `SERIALIZABLE` transaction blocks a `SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY DEFERRABLE` transaction from acquiring a snapshot until the latter determines that it is safe to avoid taking any predicate locks. See [Section 13.2.3](transaction-iso#XACT-SERIALIZABLE "13.2.3. Serializable Isolation Level") for more information about serializable and deferrable transactions.Frequent calls to this function could have some impact on database performance, because it needs access to the predicate lock manager's shared state for a short time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `version` () → `text`Returns a string describing the PostgreSQL server's version. You can also get this information from [server\_version](runtime-config-preset#GUC-SERVER-VERSION), or for a machine-readable version use [server\_version\_num](runtime-config-preset#GUC-SERVER-VERSION-NUM). Software developers should use `server_version_num` (available since 8.2) or [`PQserverVersion`](libpq-status#LIBPQ-PQSERVERVERSION) instead of parsing the text version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Note

`current_catalog`, `current_role`, `current_schema`, `current_user`, `session_user`, and `user` have special syntactic status in SQL: they must be called without trailing parentheses. In PostgreSQL, parentheses can optionally be used with `current_schema`, but not with the others.

The `session_user` is normally the user who initiated the current database connection; but superusers can change this setting with [SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION](sql-set-session-authorization "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION"). The `current_user` is the user identifier that is applicable for permission checking. Normally it is equal to the session user, but it can be changed with [SET ROLE](sql-set-role "SET ROLE"). It also changes during the execution of functions with the attribute `SECURITY DEFINER`. In Unix parlance, the session user is the “real user” and the current user is the “effective user”. `current_role` and `user` are synonyms for `current_user`. (The SQL standard draws a distinction between `current_role` and `current_user`, but PostgreSQL does not, since it unifies users and roles into a single kind of entity.)

### 9.26.2. Access Privilege Inquiry Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-INFO-ACCESS)

[Table 9.68](functions-info#FUNCTIONS-INFO-ACCESS-TABLE "Table 9.68. Access Privilege Inquiry Functions") lists functions that allow querying object access privileges programmatically. (See [Section 5.7](ddl-priv "5.7. Privileges") for more information about privileges.) In these functions, the user whose privileges are being inquired about can be specified by name or by OID (`pg_authid`.`oid`), or if the name is given as `public` then the privileges of the PUBLIC pseudo-role are checked. Also, the *`user`* argument can be omitted entirely, in which case the `current_user` is assumed. The object that is being inquired about can be specified either by name or by OID, too. When specifying by name, a schema name can be included if relevant. The access privilege of interest is specified by a text string, which must evaluate to one of the appropriate privilege keywords for the object's type (e.g., `SELECT`). Optionally, `WITH GRANT OPTION` can be added to a privilege type to test whether the privilege is held with grant option. Also, multiple privilege types can be listed separated by commas, in which case the result will be true if any of the listed privileges is held. (Case of the privilege string is not significant, and extra whitespace is allowed between but not within privilege names.) Some examples:

```

SELECT has_table_privilege('myschema.mytable', 'select');
SELECT has_table_privilege('joe', 'mytable', 'INSERT, SELECT WITH GRANT OPTION');
```

### 9.26.3. Schema Visibility Inquiry Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-INFO-SCHEMA)

[Table 9.71](functions-info#FUNCTIONS-INFO-SCHEMA-TABLE "Table 9.71. Schema Visibility Inquiry Functions") shows functions that determine whether a certain object is *visible* in the current schema search path. For example, a table is said to be visible if its containing schema is in the search path and no table of the same name appears earlier in the search path. This is equivalent to the statement that the table can be referenced by name without explicit schema qualification. Thus, to list the names of all visible tables:

```

SELECT relname FROM pg_class WHERE pg_table_is_visible(oid);
```

For functions and operators, an object in the search path is said to be visible if there is no object of the same name *and argument data type(s)* earlier in the path. For operator classes and families, both the name and the associated index access method are considered.

All these functions require object OIDs to identify the object to be checked. If you want to test an object by name, it is convenient to use the OID alias types (`regclass`, `regtype`, `regprocedure`, `regoperator`, `regconfig`, or `regdictionary`), for example:

```

SELECT pg_type_is_visible('myschema.widget'::regtype);
```

Note that it would not make much sense to test a non-schema-qualified type name in this way — if the name can be recognized at all, it must be visible.

The *`fktable`* column contains the name of the referencing catalog, and the *`fkcols`* column contains the name(s) of the referencing column(s). Similarly, the *`pktable`* column contains the name of the referenced catalog, and the *`pkcols`* column contains the name(s) of the referenced column(s). If *`is_array`* is true, the last referencing column is an array, each of whose elements should match some entry in the referenced catalog.

If *`column`* is supplied and is not zero, only the definition of that column is reconstructed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `pg_get_keywords` () → `setof record` ( *`word`* `text`, *`catcode`* `"char"`, *`barelabel`* `boolean`, *`catdesc`* `text`, *`baredesc`* `text` )Returns a set of records describing the SQL keywords recognized by the server. The *`word`* column contains the keyword. The *`catcode`* column contains a category code: `U` for an unreserved keyword, `C` for a keyword that can be a column name, `T` for a keyword that can be a type or function name, or `R` for a fully reserved keyword. The *`barelabel`* column contains `true` if the keyword can be used as a “bare” column label in `SELECT` lists, or `false` if it can only be used after `AS`. The *`catdesc`* column contains a possibly-localized string describing the keyword's category. The *`baredesc`* column contains a possibly-localized string describing the keyword's column label status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `pg_get_serial_sequence` ( *`table`* `text`, *`column`* `text` ) → `text`Returns the name of the sequence associated with a column, or NULL if no sequence is associated with the column. If the column is an identity column, the associated sequence is the sequence internally created for that column. For columns created using one of the serial types (`serial`, `smallserial`, `bigserial`), it is the sequence created for that serial column definition. In the latter case, the association can be modified or removed with `ALTER SEQUENCE OWNED BY`. (This function probably should have been called `pg_get_owned_sequence`; its current name reflects the fact that it has historically been used with serial-type columns.) The first parameter is a table name with optional schema, and the second parameter is a column name. Because the first parameter potentially contains both schema and table names, it is parsed per usual SQL rules, meaning it is lower-cased by default. The second parameter, being just a column name, is treated literally and so has its case preserved. The result is suitably formatted for passing to the sequence functions (see [Section 9.17](functions-sequence "9.17. Sequence Manipulation Functions")).A typical use is in reading the current value of the sequence for an identity or serial column, for example:     SELECT currval(pg_get_serial_sequence('sometable', 'id'));  |

| `COLLATION FOR` ( `"any"` ) → `text`Returns the name of the collation of the value that is passed to it. The value is quoted and schema-qualified if necessary. If no collation was derived for the argument expression, then `NULL` is returned. If the argument is not of a collatable data type, then an error is raised.For example:     SELECT collation for (description) FROM pg_description LIMIT 1;  pg_collation_for ------------------  "default"  SELECT collation for ('foo' COLLATE "de_DE");  pg_collation_for ------------------  "de_DE"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Most of the functions that reconstruct (decompile) database objects have an optional *`pretty`* flag, which if `true` causes the result to be “pretty-printed”. Pretty-printing suppresses unnecessary parentheses and adds whitespace for legibility. The pretty-printed format is more readable, but the default format is more likely to be interpreted the same way by future versions of PostgreSQL; so avoid using pretty-printed output for dump purposes. Passing `false` for the *`pretty`* parameter yields the same result as omitting the parameter.

| `pg_describe_object` ( *`classid`* `oid`, *`objid`* `oid`, *`objsubid`* `integer` ) → `text`Returns a textual description of a database object identified by catalog OID, object OID, and sub-object ID (such as a column number within a table; the sub-object ID is zero when referring to a whole object). This description is intended to be human-readable, and might be translated, depending on server configuration. This is especially useful to determine the identity of an object referenced in the `pg_depend` catalog. This function returns `NULL` values for undefined objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `pg_identify_object` ( *`classid`* `oid`, *`objid`* `oid`, *`objsubid`* `integer` ) → `record` ( *`type`* `text`, *`schema`* `text`, *`name`* `text`, *`identity`* `text` )Returns a row containing enough information to uniquely identify the database object specified by catalog OID, object OID and sub-object ID. This information is intended to be machine-readable, and is never translated. *`type`* identifies the type of database object; *`schema`* is the schema name that the object belongs in, or `NULL` for object types that do not belong to schemas; *`name`* is the name of the object, quoted if necessary, if the name (along with schema name, if pertinent) is sufficient to uniquely identify the object, otherwise `NULL`; *`identity`* is the complete object identity, with the precise format depending on object type, and each name within the format being schema-qualified and quoted as necessary. Undefined objects are identified with `NULL` values. |
| `pg_identify_object_as_address` ( *`classid`* `oid`, *`objid`* `oid`, *`objsubid`* `integer` ) → `record` ( *`type`* `text`, *`object_names`* `text[]`, *`object_args`* `text[]` )Returns a row containing enough information to uniquely identify the database object specified by catalog OID, object OID and sub-object ID. The returned information is independent of the current server, that is, it could be used to identify an identically named object in another server. *`type`* identifies the type of database object; *`object_names`* and *`object_args`* are text arrays that together form a reference to the object. These three values can be passed to `pg_get_object_address` to obtain the internal address of the object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `pg_get_object_address` ( *`type`* `text`, *`object_names`* `text[]`, *`object_args`* `text[]` ) → `record` ( *`classid`* `oid`, *`objid`* `oid`, *`objsubid`* `integer` )Returns a row containing enough information to uniquely identify the database object specified by a type code and object name and argument arrays. The returned values are the ones that would be used in system catalogs such as `pg_depend`; they can be passed to other system functions such as `pg_describe_object` or `pg_identify_object`. *`classid`* is the OID of the system catalog containing the object; *`objid`* is the OID of the object itself, and *`objsubid`* is the sub-object ID, or zero if none. This function is the inverse of `pg_identify_object_as_address`. Undefined objects are identified with `NULL` values.                                                                                                                                                                     |

### 9.26.6. Comment Information Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-INFO-COMMENT)

The functions shown in [Table 9.78](functions-info#FUNCTIONS-INFO-COMMENT-TABLE "Table 9.78. Comment Information Functions") extract comments previously stored with the [COMMENT](sql-comment "COMMENT") command. A null value is returned if no comment could be found for the specified parameters.

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `col_description` ( *`table`* `oid`, *`column`* `integer` ) → `text`Returns the comment for a table column, which is specified by the OID of its table and its column number. (`obj_description` cannot be used for table columns, since columns do not have OIDs of their own.)                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `obj_description` ( *`object`* `oid`, *`catalog`* `name` ) → `text`Returns the comment for a database object specified by its OID and the name of the containing system catalog. For example, `obj_description(123456, 'pg_class')` would retrieve the comment for the table with OID 123456.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `obj_description` ( *`object`* `oid` ) → `text`Returns the comment for a database object specified by its OID alone. This is *deprecated* since there is no guarantee that OIDs are unique across different system catalogs; therefore, the wrong comment might be returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `shobj_description` ( *`object`* `oid`, *`catalog`* `name` ) → `text`Returns the comment for a shared database object specified by its OID and the name of the containing system catalog. This is just like `obj_description` except that it is used for retrieving comments on shared objects (that is, databases, roles, and tablespaces). Some system catalogs are global to all databases within each cluster, and the descriptions for objects in them are stored globally as well. |

### 9.26.8. Transaction ID and Snapshot Information Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-INFO-SNAPSHOT)

The functions shown in [Table 9.80](functions-info#FUNCTIONS-PG-SNAPSHOT "Table 9.80. Transaction ID and Snapshot Information Functions") provide server transaction information in an exportable form. The main use of these functions is to determine which transactions were committed between two snapshots.

| `pg_current_xact_id` () → `xid8`Returns the current transaction's ID. It will assign a new one if the current transaction does not have one already (because it has not performed any database updates); see [Section 74.1](transaction-id "74.1. Transactions and Identifiers") for details. If executed in a subtransaction, this will return the top-level transaction ID; see [Section 74.3](subxacts "74.3. Subtransactions") for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `pg_current_xact_id_if_assigned` () → `xid8`Returns the current transaction's ID, or `NULL` if no ID is assigned yet. (It's best to use this variant if the transaction might otherwise be read-only, to avoid unnecessary consumption of an XID.) If executed in a subtransaction, this will return the top-level transaction ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `pg_xact_status` ( `xid8` ) → `text`Reports the commit status of a recent transaction. The result is one of `in progress`, `committed`, or `aborted`, provided that the transaction is recent enough that the system retains the commit status of that transaction. If it is old enough that no references to the transaction survive in the system and the commit status information has been discarded, the result is `NULL`. Applications might use this function, for example, to determine whether their transaction committed or aborted after the application and database server become disconnected while a `COMMIT` is in progress. Note that prepared transactions are reported as `in progress`; applications must check [`pg_prepared_xacts`](view-pg-prepared-xacts "54.16. pg_prepared_xacts") if they need to determine whether a transaction ID belongs to a prepared transaction. |
| `pg_current_snapshot` () → `pg_snapshot`Returns a current *snapshot*, a data structure showing which transaction IDs are now in-progress.

The internal transaction ID type `xid` is 32 bits wide and wraps around every 4 billion transactions. However, the functions shown in [Table 9.80](functions-info#FUNCTIONS-PG-SNAPSHOT "Table 9.80. Transaction ID and Snapshot Information Functions") use a 64-bit type `xid8` that does not wrap around during the life of an installation and can be converted to `xid` by casting if required; see [Section 74.1](transaction-id "74.1. Transactions and Identifiers") for details. The data type `pg_snapshot` stores information about transaction ID visibility at a particular moment in time. Its components are described in [Table 9.81](functions-info#FUNCTIONS-PG-SNAPSHOT-PARTS "Table 9.81. Snapshot Components"). `pg_snapshot`'s textual representation is `xmin:xmax:xip_list`. For example `10:20:10,14,15` means `xmin=10, xmax=20, xip_list=10, 14, 15`.

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `xmin`     | Lowest transaction ID that was still active. All transaction IDs less than `xmin` are either committed and visible, or rolled back and dead.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `xmax`     | One past the highest completed transaction ID. All transaction IDs greater than or equal to `xmax` had not yet completed as of the time of the snapshot, and thus are invisible.                                                                                                                                          |
| `xip_list` | Transactions in progress at the time of the snapshot. A transaction ID that is `xmin <= X < xmax` and not in this list was already completed at the time of the snapshot, and thus is either visible or dead according to its commit status. This list does not include the transaction IDs of subtransactions (subxids). |

In releases of PostgreSQL before 13 there was no `xid8` type, so variants of these functions were provided that used `bigint` to represent a 64-bit XID, with a correspondingly distinct snapshot data type `txid_snapshot`. These older functions have `txid` in their names. They are still supported for backward compatibility, but may be removed from a future release.

### 9.26.10. Control Data Functions [#](#FUNCTIONS-INFO-CONTROLDATA)

The functions shown in [Table 9.84](functions-info#FUNCTIONS-CONTROLDATA "Table 9.84. Control Data Functions") print information initialized during `initdb`, such as the catalog version. They also show information about write-ahead logging and checkpoint processing. This information is cluster-wide, not specific to any one database.
