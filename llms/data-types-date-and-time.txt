# Postgres Date and Time data types

> Postgres offers a rich set of native data types for storing date and time values, including DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMPTZ, and INTERVAL. These types enable precise timestamping, duration calculations, and are essential for applications in finance, logistics, and event logging.

Postgres date and time data types provide comprehensive support for temporal data with microsecond precision. This guide explains the available types, their storage requirements, and how to effectively query and manipulate date and time values in Postgres.

## Storage and syntax

There are 5 primary date/time types in Postgres:

- `DATE` - represents a date value, stored as 4 bytes. Resolution is 1 day.
- `TIME` - represents a time-of-day value, stored as 8 bytes. Resolution is 1 microsecond.
- `TIMESTAMP` - represents a combined date and time value, stored as 8 bytes. Resolution is 1 microsecond.
- `TIMESTAMPTZ` - represents a combined date and time value, along with time zone information, stored as 8 bytes. Resolution is 1 microsecond. It is stored internally as a UTC value, but is displayed in the timezone set by the client.
- `INTERVAL` - represents a duration of time, stored as 16 bytes. Resolution is 1 microsecond. Optionally, you can restrict the set of values stored to a larger unit of time (e.g., `INTERVAL MONTH`).

Date/time values are specified as string literals. Postgres accepts most of the standard datetime formats:

```sql
SELECT
    '2024-01-01'::DATE AS date_value,
    '09:00:00'::TIME AS time_value,
    '2024-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP AS timestamp_value,
    '2024-01-01 09:00:00-05'::TIMESTAMPTZ AS timestamptz_value,
    '1 month'::INTERVAL AS interval_value;
```

Special date/time literals include:

- `epoch` - represents the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)
- `infinity` - represents an infinite timestamp, greater than all other timestamps
- `-infinity` - represents an infinite timestamp, smaller than all other timestamps
- `now` - represents the current timestamp

## Example usage

Consider a conference event management system that tracks schedules for planned sessions:

```sql
CREATE TABLE conference_sessions (
    session_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    session_title TEXT NOT NULL,
    session_date DATE NOT NULL,
    start_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    planned_duration INTERVAL NOT NULL,
    finish_time TIMESTAMPTZ
);

INSERT INTO conference_sessions (session_title, session_date, start_time, planned_duration, finish_time)
VALUES
    ('Keynote Speech', '2024-05-15', '2024-05-15 09:00:00+00', '2 hours', '2024-05-15 11:30:00+00'),
    ('Data Science Workshop', '2024-05-16', '2024-05-16 11:00:00+00', '3 hours', '2024-05-16 14:00:00+00'),
    ('AI Panel Discussion', '2024-05-17', '2024-05-17 14:00:00+00', '1.5 hours', '2024-05-17 15:20:00+00');
```

### Filtering on date/time values

You can find all sessions scheduled for a specific date:

```sql
SELECT session_title, start_time
FROM conference_sessions
WHERE session_date = '2024-05-16';
```

### Arithmetic operations with date/time

You can find sessions that went over the planned duration:

```sql
SELECT session_title, planned_duration, finish_time - start_time AS actual_duration
FROM conference_sessions
WHERE finish_time - start_time > planned_duration;
```

### Aggregating date/time values

You can find the average duration of all sessions:

```sql
SELECT AVG(finish_time - start_time) AS avg_duration
FROM conference_sessions;
```

## Date and time functions

Postgres offers a variety of functions for manipulating date and time values, such as `EXTRACT`, `AGE`, `OVERLAPS`, and more.

For example, you can check if the times for any two sessions overlapped:

```sql
SELECT
    a.session_title AS session_a,
    b.session_title AS session_b,
    a.start_time as session_a_start,
    b.start_time as session_b_start
FROM conference_sessions a, conference_sessions b
WHERE a.session_id < b.session_id
AND (a.start_time, a.planned_duration) OVERLAPS (b.start_time, b.planned_duration);
```

## Handling time zones

Postgres supports adding time zone information to both time-of-day (`TIME WITH TIME ZONE`) and moment-in-time (`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` / `TIMESTAMPTZ`) values:

- If you use a time zone unaware type (e.g., `TIME` or `TIMESTAMP`), Postgres ignores any time zone information provided in the input string.
- If you use a time-zone-aware type (e.g., `TIMETZ` or `TIMESTAMPTZ`), Postgres converts the input string to UTC and stores it internally. It then displays the value in the `current time zone` set for the session.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE time_example (
    ts TIMESTAMP,
    tstz_utc TIMESTAMPTZ,
    tstz_pst TIMESTAMPTZ
);

INSERT INTO time_example (ts, tstz_utc, tstz_pst)
VALUES
    ('2024-01-01 09:00:00-08', '2024-01-01 09:00:00+00', '2024-01-01 09:00:00-08');
```

When querying with the session timezone set to UTC:

```sql
SELECT * FROM time_example;
```

Postgres ignores the timezone information for the TIMESTAMP column and returns the TIMESTAMPTZ columns in the UTC timezone.

## Additional considerations

- **Indexing**: Date/time values often involve range queries and sorting. Indexing date/time columns can significantly improve query performance.
- **Daylight Saving Time**: Working with time zones can be tricky, especially when dealing with daylight savings time.
