# Troubleshooting Neon RLS

Common issues and solutions when using Neon RLS

This page covers common errors you might encounter when implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) policies with Neon RLS and your authentication provider.

Errors:

- [`NeonDbError: password authentication failed for user 'jwk not found'`](#password-authentication-error)
- [`NeonDbError: permission denied for table X`](#permission-denied-error)
- [`invalid RSA Signing Algorithm`](#invalid-rsa-signing-algorithm)




```bash
NeonDbError: permission denied for table X
```

This error typically indicates that you haven't yet granted the necessary permissions to the `authenticated` and `anonymous` roles.

**Solution:**\
Run the following commands to grant permissions:

For existing tables:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON ALL TABLES
IN SCHEMA public
TO authenticated;

GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON ALL TABLES
IN SCHEMA public
TO anonymous;
```

For future tables:

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
IN SCHEMA public
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON TABLES
TO authenticated;

ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
IN SCHEMA public
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON TABLES
TO anonymous;
```


Neon RLS prompts you to run these commands when you first set up your authentication provider on the Neon RLS drawer in the Neon Console. If you're using a different database, you will have to run these commands manually.
