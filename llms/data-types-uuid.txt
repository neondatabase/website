# Postgres UUID data type

> UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) in Postgres are 128-bit values stored as hexadecimal digits, ideal for creating globally unique identifiers across distributed systems. They're commonly used for primary keys in scenarios where sequential IDs might reveal sensitive information or where data from multiple sources needs to be merged.

Postgres UUID data type provides a reliable way to generate globally unique identifiers for your database entities. This guide explains how to use UUIDs in Postgres, including syntax, storage considerations, and practical examples for common use cases.

## Storage and syntax

UUIDs are stored as 128-bit values, represented as a sequence of hexadecimal digits. They are typically formatted in five groups, of sizes 8, 4, 4, 4 and 12, separated by hyphens. For example:

- `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000`, or
- `a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11`

Postgres accepts UUID values in the above format, while also allowing uppercase letters and missing hyphen separators. You can also generate them using functions like `gen_random_uuid()` which is available natively in Postgres, or the `uuid_generate_v4()` function which requires the `uuid-ossp` extension.

## Example usage

Consider a scenario where we track user sessions in a web application. UUIDs are commonly used to identify sessions due to their uniqueness:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    session_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id INT,
    activity TEXT
);

INSERT INTO sessions (user_id, activity)
VALUES
    (1, 'login'),
    (2, 'view'),
    (1, 'view'),
    (1, 'logout'),
    (3, 'write')
RETURNING *;
```

This query returns session records with automatically generated UUIDs as primary keys.

To retrieve a specific session, we can query by its UUID:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sessions
WHERE session_id = 'e817b187-aba3-4b0d-a34e-a1d82319627c';
```

## Using UUID column as primary key

Using UUIDs as primary keys is common since the likelihood of the same UUID value being generated twice is very small. This is helpful in distributed systems or when merging data from different sources:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC
);

INSERT INTO products (name, price)
VALUES
    ('Apple', 1.99),
    ('Banana', 2.99),
    ('Orange', 3.99)
RETURNING *;
```

## Avoiding data leakage

In systems where data security is a concern, using non-sequential IDs like UUIDs can help obscure the total number of records, preventing potential information leaks. This is in contrast to the sequential IDs provided by the `SERIAL` data type, which can inadvertently reveal information about the number of users, orders, etc:

```sql
CREATE TABLE api_users (
    serial_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    uuid_id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO api_users (username)
VALUES
    ('user1'),
    ('user2'),
    ('user3')
RETURNING *;
```

Notice that the `serial_id` column hints at the number of rows already present in the table, while the `uuid_id` column provides no such information.

## Additional considerations

- **Randomness and uniqueness**: UUIDs are designed to be globally unique, but there's an extremely small probability of generating a duplicate UUID. If you're automatically generating UUIDs at insertion, and a duplicate UUID is generated, the insertion will fail. In the rare event that a collision occurs, applications that generate UUIDs should implement a retry mechanism.

- **Performance and indexing**: UUIDs are larger than traditional integer IDs, requiring more storage space. Index structures on UUID columns therefore consume more storage as well. However, in terms of performance for read-heavy workloads, leveraging indexed UUID columns for filtering or sorting can significantly improve query performance. In this context, you have to evaluate the tradeoff between storage efficiency and query performance.

- **Readability**: UUIDs are not human-readable, which can make debugging or manual inspection of data more challenging.
