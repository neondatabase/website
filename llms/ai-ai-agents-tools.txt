## Overview

Neon provides several ways to integrate with AI tools and agents, from natural language database control to autonomous agent frameworks. Choose the tools that fit your workflow.

## Manage databases with natural language

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI tools to interact with Neon databases using natural language, providing secure and contextual access to your data and infrastructure.

Available tools:
- [Neon MCP Server](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server): A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI tools to interact with and manage Neon databases
- [Connect MCP Clients](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon): Learn how to connect MCP clients to your Neon database

## Integrate Neon in your IDE

These tools leverage the Neon MCP server to provide natural language interfaces and AI-enhanced database management capabilities within your preferred development environment.

Available integrations:
- [Claude Desktop](https://neon.com/guides/neon-mcp-server): Use natural language to manage your databases with Claude Desktop and Neon MCP server
- [Cursor](https://neon.com/guides/cursor-mcp-neon): AI-enhanced database management in Cursor IDE
- [Cline](https://neon.com/guides/cline-mcp-neon): AI-enhanced database management with Cline
- [Windsurf](https://neon.com/guides/windsurf-mcp-neon): AI-enhanced database management in Windsurf Editor

## Ship faster with AI rules

Accelerate your development with context rules that help AI tools write better code for Neon's features.

Available rule sets:
- [Neon Auth Rules](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-auth): AI rules for implementing authentication with Neon
- [Neon Drizzle Rules](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-drizzle): AI rules for using Drizzle ORM with Neon
- [Neon Serverless Rules](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-serverless): AI rules for efficient serverless database connections

## Build AI agents

Create autonomous agents that can manage and interact with your Neon databases programmatically.

Available tools:
- [@neondatabase/toolkit](https://github.com/neondatabase/toolkit): A terse client for spinning up Postgres databases and running SQL queries

## Scale with Agent frameworks

Build AI agents using popular frameworks that integrate with Neon.

Available frameworks:
- [AgentStack Integration](https://neon.com/guides/agentstack-neon): Build and deploy AI agents with AgentStack's CLI and Neon integration
- [Composio + CrewAI](https://neon.com/guides/composio-crewai-neon): Create multi-agent systems with CrewAI and Neon
- [LangGraph Integration](https://neon.com/guides/langgraph-neon): Build stateful, multi-actor applications with LangGraph and Neon
