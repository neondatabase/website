## Preview deployments

Create a branch for each preview deployment with the Neon Postgres Previews Integration.

- **The Neon Postgres Previews Integration**: Connect your Vercel project and create a branch for each preview deployment - [https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel-previews-integration](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel-previews-integration)
- **Preview deployments with Vercel**: Blog: Read about full-stack preview deployments using the Neon Vercel Integration - [https://neon.tech/blog/neon-vercel-integration](https://neon.tech/blog/neon-vercel-integration)

## Test queries

Test potentially destructive or performance-impacting queries before your run them in production.

- **Branching — Testing queries**: Instantly create a branch to test queries before running them in production - [https://neon.tech/docs/guides/branching-test-queries](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/branching-test-queries)

## Data recovery and audits

Recover lost data or track down issues by restoring a branch to its history, or just create a point-in-time branch for historical analysis or any other reason.

- **Instant restore with Time Travel Assist**: Learn how to instantly recover your database to any point in time within your restore window - [https://neon.tech/docs/guides/branch-restore](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/branch-restore)
