# Docs glossary updater

When the user asks to "check glossary for this file," "glossary sync," "glossary review," "run docs-glossary-updater," "update the glossary," "check for obsolete glossary entries," or similar:

1. **Read** `.cursor/skills/docs-glossary-updater.md` in full.
2. **Follow** the skill: choose Mode A (doc file → missing terms), Mode B (glossary → order, cross-links, best practices, obsolete entries), or Combined as appropriate.
3. **Apply** your suggested changes to the glossary (or doc) by editing the file(s). If the user only wants a report or checklist with no edits, output that instead.

Glossary path: `content/docs/reference/glossary.md`.
