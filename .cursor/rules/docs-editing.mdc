# Neon documentation editing

When editing files under `content/docs/`, `content/guides/`, or `content/changelog/`, follow these rules. The canonical source for style and structure is the [Docs contribution guide](/docs/community/contribution-guide) and its **Style Guide** section (voice and language, capitalization, links, code blocks, frontmatter).

## Style and voice (from contribution guide)

- **Voice:** One human explaining to another; approachable and professional. Use contractions ("it's", "you're"), active voice, brief sentences, "you" for the reader. Use US English. No emojis or exclamation marks in docs.
- **No em dashes:** Do not use em dashes (—) in documentation content. Use commas, parentheses, or separate sentences instead.
- **Terminology:** One term per concept (e.g. "dashboard" not "control panel"). Link instead of repeating text from other topics.
- **Capitalization:** Sentence-style for titles; lowercase where possible. Product names and UI text match official capitalization (e.g. PostgreSQL, GitHub).
- **Code and commands:** Commands, parameters, filenames, connection strings in backticks. Connection string format: `postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]`. Use `@example.com` or example names (e.g. Alex Lopez, Dana Smith) for fake user info.

## Components and icons (documentation definition)

When editing docs, use the community documentation definition so you know all available components and icons. Load these when you need to add or validate MDX components or icons:

- **Component catalog:** Read `content/docs/community/component-guide.md` for common components (Admonition, CodeTabs, InfoBlock, Steps, etc.) and usage.
- **Icons:** Read `content/docs/community/component-icon-guide.md` for available icons and usage.
- **Specialized components:** Read `content/docs/community/component-specialized.md` for advanced/specialized components when needed.
- **Diagrams:** Read `content/docs/community/mermaid-diagrams.md` when adding or editing Mermaid diagrams.

Use the Read tool on these paths when your edit involves components, icons, or diagrams. This matches the same documentation definition used in Claude (see `.claude/commands/doc-context-bridge.md`).

## Structure and reuse

- **Shared content:** Before adding a new repeated block, check `content/docs/shared-content/` and `shared-content/index.js`. Use or extend shared components (e.g. NeedHelp, NewPricing, Admonition) rather than duplicating.
- **Cross-doc consistency:** After changing a procedure or definition, consider: "Is this same instruction stated elsewhere?" Search (e.g. by key phrase in `content/docs` and `content/guides`) and align wording or link to a single source.
- **Glossary:** When introducing or using Neon product terms (e.g. compute, branch, Activity Monitor, API key), link to `content/docs/reference/glossary.md` where appropriate, or add the term to the glossary if it is new.

## Moves and redirects

- When moving or renaming a doc, follow the redirect workflow: (1) Add `redirectFrom` on the **destination** file with the old path(s). (2) Update internal links (cross-references) to the new path. (3) Update `content/docs/navigation.yaml` if the page is in the sidebar. (4) Preserve any existing `redirectFrom` entries when moving. (5) Update hub/landing pages that link to the moved content. Full steps and examples: `.claude/commands/redirect-update.md`.

## Human review

All doc edits are reviewed via pull requests. Do not skip review; ensure PRs are created for changes.
