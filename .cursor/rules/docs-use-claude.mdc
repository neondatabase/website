# Use Claude doc guidance from Cursor

When editing docs or running documentation tasks in this repo, also use the guidance in `.claude/` so behavior matches whether you are in Cursor or Claude.

## When to load which file

- **Style and examples:** Read `.claude/commands/golden-corpus.md` for exemplary doc files by type (tutorial, get-started, concept, how-to, reference, integration, framework, hub) and Neon style patterns.
- **Full write workflow:** Read `.claude/commands/write-content.md` for the orchestrated flow (IA → drafter → refiner → syntax-validator) and when to use it.
- **One-off review:** Read `.claude/commands/review-content.md` for review criteria. For review logic and feedback shape, read `.claude/agents/content-refiner.md`.
- **Moves and redirects:** Read `.claude/commands/redirect-update.md` for the step-by-step redirect and link-update workflow.
- **Navigation and placement:** Read `.claude/commands/navigation-principles.md` for `navigation.yaml` structure. Read `.claude/agents/ia-specialist.md` for content scoping and hierarchy.
- **Changelog from other repos:** Read `.claude/commands/triage-changelog.md` for the extraction workflow; extract-analyze agents are in `.claude/agents/` (extract-analyze-console, -cli, -mcp, -storage, -compute).
- **Project layout:** Read `.claude/commands/docs-prime.md` for directory structure and key paths.
- **Components and icons:** Read `content/docs/community/component-guide.md` and `content/docs/community/component-icon-guide.md` for the full component and icon catalog; `content/docs/community/component-specialized.md` and `content/docs/community/mermaid-diagrams.md` for specialized components and diagrams. (Same documentation definition as in `.cursor/rules/docs-editing.mdc`; doc-context-bridge points Claude to the same files.)
- **Intro or small edits:** Read `.claude/commands/improve-intro.md` for intro improvements; read `.claude/agents/syntax-validator.md` for MDX/build checks.

Use the Read tool on the relevant path (e.g. `Read(".claude/commands/golden-corpus.md")`) when the task matches the description above. Skill behavior for the four Cursor skills (consistency, glossary, redirect-and-links, docs roadmap updater) is defined in `.cursor/doc-ai-tools-list.md` (Cursor section).

## When the user asks what doc AI tools are available

If the user asks "what doc AI tools are available", "what AI tools for docs", "what AI tools are available for documentation", or similar, read `.cursor/doc-ai-tools-list.md` and output the list of tools with their one- or two-sentence descriptions as your response. Do not summarize; print the list so the user gets the full reference.
