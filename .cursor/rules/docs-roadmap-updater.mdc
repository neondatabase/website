# Docs Roadmap updater

**When doing any work on the roadmap** (editing `content/docs/introduction/roadmap.md`, adding or changing bullets, or reviewing roadmap content):

1. **Always read** `.cursor/skills/docs-roadmap-updater.md` in full and follow its workflow and style rules.
2. **Do not use em dashes (—)** in the roadmap document (the content users read). Use commas, parentheses, or separate sentences instead.

When the user asks to "update the roadmap," "sync roadmap with changelog," "review roadmap against changelog," or "run roadmap updater":

1. **Read** `.cursor/skills/docs-roadmap-updater.md` in full.
2. **Follow** the skill: choose the changelog time window (default: past 1 month), load the roadmap and changelog, compare, and either report "We're already up to date!" or apply edits to the roadmap.
3. **Apply** your changes to `content/docs/introduction/roadmap.md` unless the user only wants a report.

Roadmap path: `content/docs/introduction/roadmap.md`. Changelog path: `content/changelog/` (files `YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
