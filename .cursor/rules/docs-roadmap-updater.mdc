# Docs Roadmap updater

When the user asks to "update the roadmap," "sync roadmap with changelog," "review roadmap against changelog," "run roadmap updater," or similar:

1. **Read** `.cursor/skills/docs-roadmap-updater.md` in full.
2. **Follow** the skill: choose the changelog time window (default: past 1 month), load the roadmap and changelog, compare, and either report "We're already up to date!" or apply edits to the roadmap.
3. **Apply** your changes to `content/docs/introduction/roadmap.md` unless the user only wants a report.

Roadmap path: `content/docs/introduction/roadmap.md`. Changelog path: `content/changelog/` (files `YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
