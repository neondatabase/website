# Docs command

When this command is run, or when the user asks what doc AI tools are available (e.g. "what AI tools for docs?", "what tools are available for documentation?"), read `.cursor/doc-ai-tools-list.md` and output the list of tools with their one- or two-sentence descriptions. Print the full list; do not summarize.
