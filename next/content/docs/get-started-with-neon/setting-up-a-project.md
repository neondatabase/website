title: Set up a Project
---

To set up a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. If you are creating your very first project, click **Create the first project**. Otherwise, click **New Project**.
3. Specify a name, a PostgreSQL version, a region, and click **Create Project**. Upon creating a project, you are presented with a dialog that provides connection details for the project including your password.

<Admonition type="important">
After closing the dialog, your password is no longer accessible. If you forget or misplace your password, your only option is to reset it. For instructions, see [Reset a password](../../manage/users#reset-a-password).
</Admonition>

For information about managing your Neon project, refer to the [Manage Neon overview](../../manage/overview) section of the documentation, which includes an overview of the objects that comprise a Neon project.

You can query a Neon project database from the Neon SQL Editor or a client. For instructions, see:

- [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor)
- [Connect with psql](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-psql-editor)

For information about connecting to Neon from any application or client, see [Connect from any application](../../connect/connect-from-any-app).

Most operations supported by the Neon Console can also be performed programmatically using the [Neon API](/docs/reference/api-reference).
