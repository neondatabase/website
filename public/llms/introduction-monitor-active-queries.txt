# Monitor active queries

> The "Monitor active queries" document outlines the process for Neon users to track and manage currently running SQL queries within their database environments.

You can monitor active queries for your Neon project from the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console.

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Go to **Monitoring**.
3. Select the **Active Queries** tab.

The **Active Queries** view displays up to 100 currently running queries for the selected **Branch**, **Compute**, and **Database**. Use the **Refresh** button to update the list with the latest active queries.



The **Active Queries** view is powered by the `pg_stat_activity` Postgres system view, which is available in Neon by default. To run custom queries against the data collected by `pg_stat_activity`, you can use the [Neon SQL Editor](https://neon.com/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or any SQL client, such as [psql](https://neon.com/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

For details on `pg_stat_activity`, see [pg_stat_activity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

   **Note** active queries retention: In Neon, the `pg_stat_activity` system view only holds data on currently running queries. Once a query completes, it no longer appears in the **Active Queries** view. If your Neon compute scales down to zero due to inactivity, there will be no active queries until a new connection is established and a query is run.
