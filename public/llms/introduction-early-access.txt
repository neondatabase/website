The Early Access Program is available at two levels, which you can enable independently:

## Organization Early Access

Enable Early Access for your organization to preview new features. When an organization admin enables Early Access, everyone in your organization gets access to preview features across all projects belonging to that organization.

To enable Early Access for your organization, go to your organization **Settings** page in the Neon Console and **Join early access**.

## Opting Out

If you need to opt out of Early Access later, [contact our Support team](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support) about Early Access changes to ensure there's no disruption to features you may be using.
