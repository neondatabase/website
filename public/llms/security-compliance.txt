At Neon, we prioritize data security and privacy, and we have achieved several key compliances that validate our efforts. We have completed audits for SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2, SOC 3, ISO 27001, and ISO 27701, and we adhere to GDPR and CCPA regulations.

## SOC 2

We have successfully attained SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 compliance. These compliances, validated by independent auditors, confirm that our systems adhere to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) trust service criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

## SOC 3

The SOC 3 report is a public-facing version of the SOC 2 report, providing assurance to external parties about our system's ability to meet the trust service criteria without disclosing sensitive details. Neon [Business](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#business) plan users can request this audit report through our [Trust Center](https://trust.neon.com/).

## ISO 27001

ISO 27001 is an internationally recognized standard for information security management systems (ISMS). Our compliance with this standard demonstrates that we follow a systematic and risk-based approach to managing sensitive information, ensuring its security.

## ISO 27701

ISO 27701 extends ISO 27001 to include data privacy requirements, helping organizations establish, implement, and maintain a privacy information management system (PIMS) in accordance with GDPR and other privacy laws.

## GDPR
