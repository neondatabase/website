# Scale to Zero

> The "Scale to Zero" documentation explains how Neon automatically scales down compute resources to zero during inactivity, optimizing resource usage and cost efficiency for database operations.

Neon's _Scale to Zero_ feature suspends the Neon compute that runs your Postgres database after a period of inactivity, which minimizes costs for databases that aren't always active, such as development or test environment databases â€” and even production databases that aren't used 24/7.

- When your database is inactive, it automatically scales to zero after 5 minutes. This means you pay only for active time instead of 24/7 compute usage. No manual intervention is required.
- Once you query the database again, it reactivates automatically within a few hundred milliseconds.

The diagram below illustrates the _Scale to Zero_ behavior alongside Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature. The compute usage line highlights an _inactive_ period, followed by a period where the compute is automatically suspended until it's accessed again.



Neon compute scales to zero after an _inactive_ period of 5 minutes. For [Neon Free Plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan) users, this setting is fixed. Paid plan users can disable the scale-to-zero setting to maintain an always-active compute.

You can enable or disable the scale-to-zero setting by editing your compute settings. For detailed instructions, see [Configuring scale to zero for Neon computes](https://neon.com/docs/guides/scale-to-zero-guide).
