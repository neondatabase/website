# Open API

> The document outlines how to integrate and utilize Open API plugins within Neon's platform, detailing the steps and configurations necessary for seamless API interactions and management.

## Source

- [Open API HTML](https://neon.com/docs/auth/guides/plugins/openapi): The original HTML version of this documentation

**Note** Beta: The **Neon Auth with Better Auth** is in Beta. Share your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or via the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback).

Neon Auth is built on [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) and comes with the Open API plugin enabled by default. You do not need to manually install or configure it.

The OpenAPI plugin provides two main features:

1. An interactive **API reference UI** (powered by [Scalar](https://scalar.com/)) to explore and test all available Neon Auth endpoints.
2. A **JSON Schema endpoint** that you can use to generate type-safe clients for your application.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon project with **Auth enabled**.

## Accessing the API reference

You can view the interactive documentation for your specific project by appending `/reference` to your Neon Auth URL.

**URL Format:**

```
<YOUR_NEON_AUTH_URL>/reference
```

**Example:**
`https://ep-xxx.aws.neon.tech/neondb/auth/reference`

This interface allows you to:

- Browse all available endpoints (grouped by Core, Session, User, Plugins, etc).
- View request and response schemas.
- **"Try it out"**: Make real API requests against your database directly from the browser.



   **Note** Testing endpoints: When using the "Try it out" feature, you are interacting with your live database. Be careful when testing endpoints that modify or delete data (like `admin.banUser` or `organization.delete`).

## JSON schema

If you need the raw OpenAPI 3.x specification (for example, to import into Postman or Insomnia), it is available at the `/open-api/generate-schema` endpoint.

**URL format:**

```
<YOUR_NEON_AUTH_URL>/open-api/generate-schema
```

This endpoint returns a standard JSON object describing your authentication API.

## Generating API clients

One of the most powerful use cases for the OpenAPI plugin is generating type-safe API clients for languages that do not yet have a dedicated Neon Auth SDK, or for server-side integration where you prefer raw fetch calls.

### Using Scalar SDK generator

If you're using Next.js, you can access the OpenAPI reference page at `/api/auth/reference` in your application, once Neon Auth is set up according to the [Next.js guide](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/nextjs). Unlike the default Neon Auth reference page, this version can be fully customized to match your application's theme. It also provides additional options, such as generating SDK clients in multiple languages using Scalar's [built‑in tools](https://guides.scalar.com/scalar/scalar-sdks/getting-started).

## Limitations

Because Neon Auth is a managed service, the OpenAPI configuration is preset:

- **Path:** The reference UI is always served at `/reference`.
- **Theme:** The UI uses the default Scalar theme and cannot be customized.
- **Discovery:** The reference doc automatically reflects the plugins enabled in your Neon Auth instance.
