## Example workflows

### Check your Neon usage statistics

Open a DM with the Neon App for Slack and run the following command to instantly view your current data transfer, compute time, and storage usage across all projects:

```
/neon usage
```



### Usage notifications

You can receive automated notifications about your Neon usage in any channel (public or private). First, subscribe to notifications using the steps in the section below. Once subscribed, the channel will receive automatic notifications when you approach or reach your resource limits for compute hours, storage, or data transfer.

### Subscribe to notifications in a channel

To receive Neon notifications in a Slack channel:

1. Go to any channel (public or private) where you want to receive notifications
2. Run `/neon subscribe` - you'll be prompted to run `/invite @Neon (Beta)` if needed
3. After inviting the bot, run `/neon subscribe` again

Once subscribed, the channel will start receiving important Neon usage notifications. To stop receiving notifications, use the `/neon unsubscribe` command in the same channel.

Use `/neon disconnect` to remove your Neon account connection and unsubscribe from all channels, while keeping the app installed for future use.

Neon respects your right to request deletion of your personal data at any time. To do so, email us at `privacy@neon.tech` or submit a support ticket via the Neon Console.
