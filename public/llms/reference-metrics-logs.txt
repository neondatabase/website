# Metrics and logs reference

> The "Metrics and Logs Reference" document outlines the metrics and logging capabilities within Neon, detailing how to monitor and analyze system performance and operational data effectively.

## Source

- [Metrics and logs reference HTML](https://neon.com/docs/reference/metrics-logs): The original HTML version of this documentation

This page provides a comprehensive reference for all metrics and log fields that Neon exports to observability platforms through integrations like [Datadog](https://neon.com/docs/guides/datadog) and [OpenTelemetry](https://neon.com/docs/guides/opentelemetry).

## Available metrics

Neon makes the following metrics available for export to third parties through our observability integrations.

All metrics include the following labels:

- `project_id`
- `endpoint_id`
- `compute_id`
- `job`

Here's an example of the metric `db_total_size` with all labels:

```json
neon_db_total_size{project_id="square-daffodil-12345678", endpoint_id="ep-aged-art-260862", compute_id="compute-shrill-blaze-b4hry7fg", job="sql-metrics"} 10485760
```

   **Note**: In Datadog, metric labels are referred to as `tags.` See [Getting Started with Tags](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/) in the Datadog Docs.

We collect stats from the oldest non-system databases based on their creation time, but not for all databases. Only the first X databases (sorted by creation time) are included.

**datname**: The name of the database
**kind**: The type of value being reported. One of the following:
- **db_size**: The size of the database on disk, in bytes (`pg_database_size(datname)`)
- **deadlocks**: The number of deadlocks detected
- **inserted**: The number of rows inserted (`tup_inserted`)
- **updated**: The number of rows updated (`tup_updated`)
- **deleted**: The number of rows deleted (`tup_deleted`) |

## Postgres logs

Neon can export Postgres logs to observability platforms, providing visibility into database activity, errors, and performance. These logs include:

- Error messages and warnings
- Connection events
- System notifications

### Log fields and metadata

Logs include the following labels and metadata for filtering and organization:

- `project_id`
- `endpoint_id`
- Timestamp
- Log level
- And other standard PostgreSQL log fields

   **Note**: During the beta phase, you may see some Neon-specific system logs included. These will be filtered out before general availability (GA).

### Performance considerations

Enabling log export may result in:

- An increase in compute resource usage for log processing
- Additional network egress for log transmission (Neon does not charge for data transfer on paid plans)
- Associated costs based on log volume in your observability platform

   **Note**: Neon computes only send logs and metrics when they are active. If the [Scale to Zero](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/scale-to-zero) feature is enabled and a compute is suspended due to inactivity, no logs or metrics will be sent during the suspension. This may result in gaps in your data. Additionally, if you are setting up an integration for a project with an inactive compute, you'll need to activate the compute before it can send data. To activate it, simply run a query from the [Neon SQL Editor](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or any connected client.

### Technical details

Neon processes logs directly on each compute instance using [rsyslogd](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/index.html), an industry-standard open source logging utility. This compute-level processing means that log collection contributes to your compute's resource usage.
