# Neon Local Connect Extension

> The document details the setup and usage of Neon Local Connect extension, enabling users to connect and manage Neon databases directly within VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other compatible editors.

## Source

- [Neon Local Connect Extension HTML](https://neon.com/docs/local/neon-local-connect): The original HTML version of this documentation

The Neon Local Connect extension lets you connect to any Neon branch using a familiar localhost connection string. Available for VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code-compatible editors, the underlying Neon Local service handles the routing, authentication, and branch management behind the scenes. Your app connects to `localhost:5432` like a local Postgres instance, but Neon Local routes traffic to your actual Neon branch in the cloud.

You can use this connection string in your app:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://neon:npg@localhost:5432/<database_name>"
```

Switch branches, and your app keeps using the same connection string.

## What you can do

With the Neon Local Connect extension, you can:

- Instantly connect to any Neon branch using a single, static localhost connection string
- Create, switch, or reset branches directly from the extension panel
- Automate ephemeral branch creation and cleanup, no scripts required
- Open the Neon SQL Editor or Table View for your current branch with one click
- Launch a psql shell in your integrated terminal for direct SQL access

All without leaving your editor.

## Requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running
- [VS Code 1.85.0+](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), or other VS Code-compatible editor
- A [Neon account](https://neon.tech) and [API key](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys) (for ephemeral branches only; you can also create new keys from the extension)

## Install the extension

The Neon Local Connect extension is available on both marketplaces:

**For VS Code:**
- Open the [Neon Local Connect extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=databricks.neon-local-connect) in the VS Code Marketplace.
- Click **Install**.

**For Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code-compatible editors:**
- Open the [Neon Local Connect extension page](https://open-vsx.org/extension/databricks/neon-local-connect) in the OpenVSX Registry.
- Click **Install** or follow your editor's extension installation process.

## Sign in to Neon

- Open the Neon Local Connect panel in the VS Code sidebar and click **Sign in**.

  

- Authenticate with Neon in your browser when prompted.

  

## Connect to a branch

You'll need to make a few selections — organization, project, and then branch — before connecting. If you're new to Neon, this reflects our object hierarchy: organizations contain projects, and projects contain branches. [Learn more about how Neon organizes your data.](https://neon.com/docs/manage/overview)

You can connect to two types of branches:

- **Existing branch:**  
  For ongoing development, features, or team collaboration. The branch remains available until you delete it. Use this when you want to keep your changes and collaborate with others.

- **Ephemeral branch:**  
  For temporary, disposable environments (tests, CI, experiments). The extension creates the branch when you connect and deletes it automatically when you disconnect—no manual cleanup required. In CI or CLI workflows, you'd have to script this yourself. The extension does it for you.

As part of choosing your connection, you'll also be asked to choose driver type: **PostgreSQL** for most Postgres connections, or **Neon serverless** for edge/HTTP. [Read more about connection types](https://neon.com/docs/connect/choose-connection).

Tab: Existing branch

Connect to an existing branch (e.g., `main`, `development`, or a feature branch):



Tab: Ephemeral branch

Connect to an ephemeral branch (created just for your session):



   **Note**: Selecting an ephemeral branch will prompt you to create and import API key for authentication.

## Use the static connection string

After connecting, find your local connection string in the extension panel. Copy it, update with your database name, and add it to your app's `.env` or config.



```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://neon:npg@localhost:5432/<database_name>"
```

Your app connects to `localhost:5432`, while the Neon Local service routes the traffic to your actual Neon branch in the cloud.

> You only need to set this connection string once, no matter how many times you create, switch, or reset branches. Neon Local handles all the routing behind the scenes, so you never have to update your app config again.

## Start developing

Your application now connects to `localhost:5432` using the driver you selected in the extension (Postgres or Neon serverless). See the quickstart for your language or framework for more details.
