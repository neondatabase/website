# Full Twin

> The "Full Twin" documentation guides Neon users on how to create a complete replica of a PostgreSQL database using the pg_dump and restore process, ensuring data consistency and redundancy.

## Source

- [Full Twin HTML](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-twin-full-pg-dump-restore): The original HTML version of this documentation

This workflow will create a full Neon Twin using `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.

   **Note**: To use this workflow, you'll need the Postgres connection string for your Neon database. Follow our [Getting Started Guide](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/signing-up#sign-up) to learn how.

## Create the workflow

To create the Twin workflow in any GitHub-hosted repository:

1. Create a new directory named `.github` at the root of your project.
2. Inside this directory, create another directory named `workflows`.
3. Within the `workflows` directory, create a new file named `create-neon-twin.yml`.

```
.github
  |-- workflows
      |-- create-neon-twin.yml
```

Add the following code to `create-neon-twin.yml`.

```yml
name: Create Neon Twin

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs at midnight UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  PROD_DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PROD_DATABASE_URL }} # Production or primary database
  DEV_DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DEV_DATABASE_URL }} # Development database
  PG_VERSION: '17'

jobs:
  dump-and-restore:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Install PostgreSQL
        run: |
          sudo apt update
          yes '' | sudo /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh
          sudo apt install -y postgresql-${{ env.PG_VERSION }}

      - name: Set PostgreSQL binary path
        run: echo "POSTGRES=/usr/lib/postgresql/${{ env.PG_VERSION }}/bin" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Dump and restore data
        run: |
          $POSTGRES/pg_dump -Fc -f "${{ github.workspace }}/dump-file.bak" "${{ env.PROD_DATABASE_URL }}"
          $POSTGRES/pg_restore --clean --no-owner --no-acl --if-exists -d "${{ env.DEV_DATABASE_URL }}" "${{ github.workspace }}/dump-file.bak"
```

## GitHub Action explained

Below is an explanation of each part of the GitHub Action.

### on

- `name`: The name of the Action as it appears in the GitHub UI.
- `cron`: The [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07) that defines when the Action will run.
- `workflow_dispatch`: Enables manual triggering through the GitHub UI.

### env

- `PROD_DATABASE_URL`: The PostgreSQL connection string for your production database.
- `DEV_DATABASE_URL`: The PostgreSQL connection string for your Neon database.
- `PG_VERSION`: The version of PostgreSQL to install in the Action environment.

### steps

- `Install PostgreSQL`: Installs the specified version of PostgreSQL into the Action environment from the [Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt) repository.
- `Set PostgreSQL binary path`: Creates `$POSTGRES` variable for use in subsequent steps.
- `Dump and restore data`: Uses `pg_dump` to create a `dump-file.bak` and `pg_restore` to read the `dump-file.bak` and apply it to the `DEV_DATABASE_URL`.

### pg_dump flags

The table below provides an explanation of each flag used by `pg_dump`.

| Flag | Meaning                                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -FC  | Dumps the database in a custom format.                          |
| -f   | Specifies the output file where the schema dump will be stored. |

### pg_restore flags

The table below provides an explanation of each flag used by `pg_restore`.

| Flag        | Meaning                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --clean     | Drops existing database objects before recreating them, ensuring a clean restore.                              |
| --no-owner  | Ignores ownership information in the dump file, so restored objects are owned by the user running the restore. |
| --no-acl    | Excludes access control (GRANT/REVOKE) statements from the restore, preventing permission changes.             |
| --if-exists | Ensures that `DROP` commands (used with `--clean`) only execute if the object exists, preventing errors.       |
| -d          | Specifies the target database to restore into.                                                                 |

## Setting repository secrets

Before running the Action, ensure that both `PROD_DATABASE_URL` and `DEV_DATABASE_URL` are added to your GitHub repository secrets.

In your repository, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** to add them.



## Testing the workflow

To manually trigger your workflow go to **Actions** > **Create Neon Twin** then click **Run workflow**. From the dropdown, click the **Run workflow** button.



## Syncing with migration changes

The GitHub Action runs on a recurring schedule, but you may also want it to trigger when migration changes are applied and a Pull Request is merged. To enable this, update the Action with the following code:

### Handling Pull Request Events

Add a `pull_request` event and configure it to listen for merges into the main `branch`.

```diff
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs at midnight UTC
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

```

### Add Concurrency and Conditions

To prevent conflicts between scheduled runs and runs triggered by a Pull Request, set `cancel-in-progress` to `true` under `concurrency`. Additionally, add an `if` statement to ensure the job only executes when specific conditions are met.

```diff
jobs:
  dump-and-restore:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: 'dump-and-restore'
      cancel-in-progress: true
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'schedule' || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.merged == true)
```

## Limitations

Be aware of [usage limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/administering-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits): Each GitHub Action job can run for up to 6 hours. If a job exceeds this limit, it will be terminated and fail to complete.

If your dump/restore process takes longer, consider using [self-hosted runners](https://neon.com/guides/gihub-actions-self-hosted-runners).
