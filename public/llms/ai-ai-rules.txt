# AI Rules and Prompts

> The "AI Rules and Prompts" document outlines guidelines and examples for creating effective AI prompts within the Neon platform, assisting users in leveraging AI capabilities for database management tasks.

Boost your productivity with AI context rules for Neon. These rules help AI tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/) understand Neon's features, leading to more accurate code suggestions and fewer common mistakes.

## Available rules

- [Neon Auth](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-auth): Stack Auth integration, database syncing, and authentication patterns
- [Neon Serverless](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-serverless): Efficient queries, connection pooling, and serverless best practices
- [Neon + Drizzle](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-drizzle): ORM setup, schema management, and usage patterns with Drizzle

## How it works

AI rules are `.mdc` files that specify which types of files they apply to (such as `*.tsx` or `schema.sql`). When you're working with a matching file, your AI tool automatically applies the relevant rules to provide better suggestions.

### Example: AI rules in action

Here's a practical example using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so). A developer has implemented authentication in their server-rendered page and wants to confirm best practices:

**Developer query**: _"Using the neon-auth.mdc rule, how do I secure a server-rendered page?"_



The AI confirms that using `stackServerApp.getUser({ or: "redirect" })` is the correct approach for server-side authentication, providing additional context and explanation.

## Add rules to your project

Add these files to your project's `.cursor/rules` folder:

```text
.cursor/
  rules/
    neon-auth.mdc
    neon-serverless.mdc
    neon-drizzle.mdc
```

Most AI tools will automatically apply these rules when you're working with Neon-related code. You can also reference them explicitly in prompts for more targeted assistance.
