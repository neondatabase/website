## Chat with your data

Within the chat session, you can start asking your database questions.

For example, suppose you have a `user` table with a column named `dbType` that indicates the type of database.

If you want to know what the four most popular databases are and visualize the distribution in a pie chart, you can quickly and easily do so with a natural language question, as shown below:
