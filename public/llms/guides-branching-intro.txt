## Preview deployments

Create a branch for each preview deployment with the Neon Postgres Previews Integration.

- [The Neon Postgres Previews Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-previews-integration): Connect your Vercel project and create a branch for each preview deployment

## Test queries

Test potentially destructive or performance-impacting queries before your run them in production.

- [Branching â€” Testing queries](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branching-test-queries): Instantly create a branch to test queries before running them in production

## Data recovery and audits

Recover lost data or track down issues by restoring a branch to its history, or just create a point-in-time branch for historical analysis or any other reason.
