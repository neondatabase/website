Neon provides several ways to integrate with AI tools and agents, from natural language database control to autonomous agent frameworks. Choose the tools that fit your workflow.

## Manage databases with natural language

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI tools to interact with Neon databases using natural language, providing secure and contextual access to your data and infrastructure.

- [Neon MCP Server](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server): A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI tools to interact with and manage Neon databases
- [Connect MCP Clients](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon): Learn how to connect MCP clients to your Neon database

## Integrate Neon in your IDE

These tools leverage the Neon MCP server to provide natural language interfaces and
AI-enhanced database management capabilities within your preferred development environment.
