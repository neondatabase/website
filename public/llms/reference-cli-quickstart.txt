The Neon CLI is a command-line interface that lets you manage Neon directly from the terminal. This guide will help you quickly set up and start using the Neon CLI.

## Install the CLI

Choose your platform and install the Neon CLI:

Tab: macOS

**Install with Homebrew**

```bash
brew install neonctl
```

**Install via npm**

```shell
npm i -g neonctl
```

**Install with bun**

```bash
bun install -g neonctl
```

Tab: Windows

**Install via npm**

```shell
npm i -g neonctl
```

**Install with bun**

```bash
bun install -g neonctl
```

Tab: Linux

**Install via npm**

```shell
npm i -g neonctl
```

**Install with bun**

```bash
bun install -g neonctl
```

Verify the installation by checking the CLI version:

```bash
neon --version
```

For the latest version, refer to the [Neon CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/neondatabase/neonctl)

## Authenticate

Authenticate with your Neon account using one of these methods:

**Web Authentication (recommended)**

Run the command below to authenticate through your browser:

```bash
neon auth
```

This will open a browser window where you can authorize the CLI to access your Neon account.

**API Key Authentication**

Alternatively, you can use a personal Neon API key. You can create one in the Neon Console. See [Create a personal API key](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys#create-a-personal-api-key).

```bash
neon projects list --api-key <your-api-key>
```

To avoid entering your API key with each command, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export NEON_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

For more about authenticating, see [Neon CLI commands — auth](https://neon.com/docs/reference/cli-auth).

## Set up your context file

Context files allow you to use CLI commands without specifying your project ID or organization ID with each command.

To set the context for your Neon project:

```bash
neon set-context --project-id <your-project-id>
```

To set the context for your both your Neon organization and a Neon project:

```bash
neon set-context --org-id <your-org-id> --project-id <your-project-id>
```

   **Info**: You can find your organization ID in the Neon Console by selecting your organization and navigating to **Settings**. You can find your Neon project ID by opening your project in the Neon Console and navigating to **Settings** > **General**.

The `set-context` command creates a `.neon` file in your current directory with your project context.

```bash
$ cat .neon

{
  "projectId": "broad-surf-52155946",
  "orgId": "org-solid-base-83603457"
}%
```

You can also create named context files for different organization and project contexts:

```bash
neon set-context --org-id <your-org-id> --project-id <your-project-id> --context-file dev_project
```

To switch contexts, add the `--context-file` option to any command, specifying your context file:

```bash
neon branches list --context-file Documents/dev_project
```

For more about the `set-context` command, see [Neon CLI commands — set-context](https://neon.com/docs/reference/cli-set-context).

## Enable shell completion

Next, you can set up autocompletion to make using the CLI faster:

Tab: Bash

```bash
neon completion >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Tab: Zsh

```bash
neon completion >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can press **Tab** to complete Neon CLI commands and options. For further details, see [Neon CLI commands — completion](https://neon.com/docs/reference/cli-completion).

## Common operations

Here are some common operations you can perform with the Neon CLI:

### List your projects

```bash
neon projects list
```

If you want to list projects in your organization, don't forget to set your organization context or specify `--org-id <your-org-id>`. Otherwise, you'll list the projects in your personal Neon account.

For more about the `projects` command, see [Neon CLI commands — projects](https://neon.com/docs/reference/cli-projects).

### Create a branch

```bash
neon branches create --name <branch-name>
```

Set your project context or specify `--project-id <your-project-id>` if you have more than one Neon project.

For more about the `branches` command, see [Neon CLI commands — branches](https://neon.com/docs/reference/cli-branches).

### Get a connection string

This will give you the connection string for the default branch in your project:

```bash
neon connection-string
```

For a specific branch, specify the branch name:

```bash
neon connection-string <branch-name>
```

There's lots more you can do with the `connection-string` command. See [Neon CLI commands — connection-string](https://neon.com/docs/reference/cli-connection-string).

## Next steps

Now that you're set up with the Neon CLI, you can:

- Create more Neon projects with `neon projects create`
- Manage your branches with various `neon branches` commands such as `reset`, `restore`, `rename`, `schema-diff`, and more
- Create and manage databases with `neon databases` commands
- Create and manage roles with `neon roles` commands
- View the full set of Neon CLI commands available to you with `neon --help`

For more details on all available commands, see the [CLI Reference](https://neon.com/docs/reference/neon-cli).
