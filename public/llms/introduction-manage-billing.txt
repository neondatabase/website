## View the Billing page

You can view and manage billing from the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.

To access your **Billing** page:

1. Navigate to the Neon Console.
1. Select your organization from the breadcrumb menu at the top-left of the console.
1. Select **Billing** from the menu to view the charges to date.

On the **Billing** page, you will find a summary outlining current charges and the details of your plan, your payment information, and your monthly invoices.

## Update your payment method

To update your payment method:

1. Navigate to the Neon Console.
1. Select your organization from the breadcrumb menu at the top-left of the console.
1. Select **Billing** from the menu.
1. Navigate to the **Payment info** section of the page.
1. Locate **Payment method** and click **Edit**.

If you are unable to update your payment method, please [contact support](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/support).

## Payment issues

### Missed payments

If an auto-debit payment transaction fails, Neon sends a request to update your payment method. Late fees and payment policies are described in [Neon's Terms of Service](https://neon.com/terms-of-service).

### Failing payments for Indian customers

Neon's billing system uses **Stripe Checkout**, which does not currently support **e-Mandates** â€” a requirement from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for automatic recurring payments. Because of this, customers in India cannot set up automatic monthly payments. In the event of a payment failure, please [contact support](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/support) to request a link to your invoice to complete the payment manually.

## Update your billing email

To update your billing email:

1. Navigate to the Neon Console.
1. Select your organization from the breadcrumb menu at the top-left of the console.
1. Select **Billing** from the menu.
1. Navigate to the **Payment info** section of the page.
1. Locate **Billing email** and click **Edit**.

If you are unable to update your billing email, please [contact support](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/support).

## Invoices

A Neon invoice includes the charges and the amount due for the billing period. For an explanation of what you've been billed for, see [Usage metrics](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#usage-metrics).

### Download invoices

To download an invoice:

1. Navigate to the Neon Console.
1. Select your organization from the breadcrumb menu at the top-left of the console.
1. Select **Billing** from the menu.
1. Navigate to the **Invoices** section of the page.
1. Find the invoice you want to download and select **Download** from the menu.

   **Note**: When an invoice is paid, Neon's billing system sends a payment confirmation email to the address associated with the Neon account.

### Request a refund

If you find an issue with your invoice, you can request a refund. The request will be reviewed by the Neon billing team.

1. Navigate to the Neon Console.
1. Select your organization from the breadcrumb menu at the top-left of the console.
1. Select **Billing** from the menu.
1. Click the "View past invoices" button.
1. Find the invoice you want to request a refund for, and select **Request credit note** from the menu. Enter a problem description explaining the reason for the request.

## Change your plan

   **Important**: You cannot upgrade or downgrade to a [legacy plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/legacy-plans). If you're currently on a legacy plan, you can only upgrade or downgrade to one of the [current usage-based pricing plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans).

To upgrade or downgrade your plan:

1. Navigate to the Neon Console.
1. Select your organization from the breadcrumb menu at the top-left of the console.
1. Select **Billing** from the menu.
1. Select **Change plan**.

Changing your plan to one with lower usage allowances may affect the performance of your applications. To compare plan allowances, see [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#neon-plans).

If you are downgrading your plan, you will be required to remove any projects, branches, or data that exceed your new plan allowances.

To downgrade from a **legacy Enterprise plan**, please contact [Sales](https://neon.com/contact-sales). Cancellation of a legacy Enterprise plan is handled according to the Master Subscription Agreement (MSA) outlined in the Customer Agreement.

## How to prevent further monthly charges to your account

If you're on a Neon paid plan, you need to downgrade to the Free plan to avoid further monthly charges. You can do so from the [Billing](https://console.neon.tech/app/billing#change_plan) page in the Neon Console. Simply removing all Neon projects will **not** stop the monthly fee associated with your plan. You will continue to be invoiced until you downgrade to Free.

## Delete your account

If you would like to delete your Neon account entirely, please refer to the steps described here: [Deleting your account](https://neon.com/docs/manage/accounts#delete-account).
