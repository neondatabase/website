# Neon Auth

> The Neon Auth documentation outlines the authentication mechanisms and configurations available for managing user access within the Neon platform, detailing the use of roles, permissions, and integration with external identity providers.

**Note** Beta: The **Neon Auth with Better Auth** is in Beta. Share your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or via the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback).

Neon Auth is a managed authentication service that stores users, sessions, and auth configuration directly in your Neon database. When you branch your database, your entire auth state branches with it. This lets you test real authentication workflows in preview environments.

   **Note** Before you start: Neon Auth is in active development. Check the [roadmap](https://neon.com/docs/auth/roadmap) to see what's supported and what's coming next.

## Why Neon Auth?

- **Identity lives in your database**  
  All authentication data is stored in the `neon_auth` schema. It's queryable with SQL and compatible with Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

- **Zero server management**  
  Neon Auth runs as a managed REST API service. Configure settings in the Console; use the [SDK](https://neon.com/docs/reference/javascript-sdk) in your app. No infrastructure to maintain.

- **Auth that branches with your data**  
  Test sign-up, login, password reset, and OAuth flows in isolated branches without touching production data.

## Built on Better Auth

Neon Auth is powered by [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/), which means you get familiar APIs. You can use Better Auth UI components or call auth methods directly to build your own UI.

Neon Auth currently supports Better Auth version **1.4.6**.

## Basic usage

Enable Auth in your Neon project, then add authentication to your app:

```typescript filename="src/auth.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from '@neondatabase/neon-js/auth';

export const authClient = createAuthClient(import.meta.env.VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL);
```

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx"
import { NeonAuthUIProvider, AuthView } from '@neondatabase/neon-js/auth/react/ui';
import { authClient } from './auth';

export default function App() {
  return (
    
  );
}
```

## Use cases

- **Production authentication**  
  Use Neon Auth as the identity system for your app. Store users, sessions, and OAuth configuration directly in Postgres, and pair with RLS for secure, database-centric access control.

- **Preview environments**  
  Test full authentication flows in Vercel previews with real users and sessions

- **Multi-tenant SaaS**  
  Test complex org and role hierarchies safely in isolated branches

- **CI/CD workflows**  
  Run end-to-end auth tests without touching production. The [Neon Create Branch GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/neon-create-branch-github-action) supports retrieving branch-specific auth URLs for testing authentication flows in GitHub Actions workflows.

- **Development workflows**  
  Spin up complete environments instantly with database and auth together

See [Branching authentication](https://neon.com/docs/auth/branching-authentication) for details on how auth branches with your database.

## Quick start guides

## Availability

Neon Auth is currently available for AWS regions only. Azure support is not yet available.

## Pricing

Neon Auth is included in all Neon plans based on Monthly Active Users (MAU):

- **Free**: Up to 60,000 MAU
- **Launch**: Up to 1M MAU
- **Scale**: Up to 1M MAU

An MAU (Monthly Active User) is a unique user who authenticates at least once during a monthly billing period. If you need more than 1M MAU, [contact Sales](https://neon.com/contact-sales).

See [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#auth) for more details.

## Migration from Stack Auth

If you're using the previous Neon Auth implementation via Stack Auth, your version will continue to work. When you're ready to migrate to the new Better Auth implementation, see our [migration guide](https://neon.com/docs/auth/migrate/from-legacy-auth).
