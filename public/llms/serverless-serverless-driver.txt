# Neon serverless driver

> This guide explains how to connect to Neon from serverless environments over HTTP or WebSockets, covering installation, configuration, and usage examples for both HTTP and WebSocket connections.

- [Neon serverless driver HTML](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver): The original HTML version of this documentation

The [Neon serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that allows you to query data from serverless and edge environments over **HTTP** or **WebSockets** in place of TCP. The driver's low-latency capability is due to [message pipelining and other optimizations](https://neon.tech/blog/quicker-serverless-postgres).

When to query over HTTP vs WebSockets:

- **HTTP**: Querying over an HTTP [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) request is faster for single, non-interactive transactions, also referred to as "one-shot queries". Issuing [multiple queries](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver#issue-multiple-queries-with-the-transaction-function) via a single, non-interactive transaction is also supported. See [Use the driver over HTTP](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver#use-the-driver-over-http).
- **WebSockets**: If you require session or interactive transaction support or compatibility with [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) (the popular **npm** `pg` package), use WebSockets. See [Use the driver over WebSockets](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver#use-the-driver-over-websockets).

## Install the Neon serverless driver

You can install the driver with your preferred JavaScript package manager. For example:

```shell
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

The driver includes TypeScript types (the equivalent of `@types/pg`). No additional installation is required.

The Neon serverless driver is also available as a [JavaScript Registry (JSR)](https://jsr.io/docs/introduction) package: [https://jsr.io/@neon/serverless](https://jsr.io/@neon/serverless). The JavaScript Registry (JSR) is a package registry for JavaScript and TypeScript. JSR works with many runtimes (Node.js, Deno, browsers, and more) and is backward compatible with `npm`.

## Configure your Neon database connection

You can obtain a connection string for your database by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**. Your Neon connection string will look something like this:

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

The examples that follow assume that your database connection string is assigned to a `DATABASE_URL` variable in your application's environment file.

## Use the driver over HTTP

The Neon serverless driver uses the [neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#neon-function) function for queries over HTTP.

You can use raw SQL queries or tools such as [Drizzle-ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/neon), [kysely](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely), [Zapatos](https://jawj.github.io/zapatos/), and others for type safety.

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const posts = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
// `posts` is now [{ id: 12, title: 'My post', ... }] (or undefined)
```

```typescript
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { posts } from './schema';

export default async () => {
  const postId = 12;
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
  const db = drizzle(sql);
  const [onePost] = await db.select().from(posts).where(eq(posts.id, postId));
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ post: onePost }));
};
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export default async (req: Request) => {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  const posts = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
  // or using query() for parameterized queries
  const posts = await sql.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(posts));
}

export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};
```

```ts
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(request: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
  const posts = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
  // or using query() for parameterized queries
  const posts = await sql.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
  return res.status(200).json(posts);
}
```

The maximum request size and response size for queries over HTTP is 64 MB.
