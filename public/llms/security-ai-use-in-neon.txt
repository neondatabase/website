Neon integrates AI to enhance user experience across different parts of the platform. Below is an overview of where and how AI is used in Neon.

## AI in the Neon SQL Editor

The Neon SQL Editor includes AI-powered features to assist with writing, optimizing, and generating names for SQL queries. To enable these capabilities, we share your database schema with the AI agent, but **no actual data is shared**.

Neon currently uses [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) as the LLM provider for the Neon SQL Editor. All requests are processed within AWS's secure infrastructure, where other Neon resources are also managed.

For more details, see [AI features in the Neon SQL Editor](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/query-with-neon-sql-editor#ai-features).
