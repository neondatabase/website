# Time Travel tutorial

> The "Time Travel tutorial" document guides Neon users through the process of using time travel features to query historical data states within their databases.

This guide demonstrates how you could use Time Travel to address a common development scenario: debugging issues following a CI/CD deployment to production.

In this scenario, your team has recently introduced a streamlined checkout process, managed by a `new_checkout_process` feature flag. Soon after this flag was enabled, customer support started receiving complaints related to the new feature. As a developer, you're tasked with investigating the issues to confirm whether they are directly linked to the feature's activation.

## Before You Start

To follow this tutorial, you'll need:

- A Neon account. [Sign up here](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/signing-up).
- A [restore window](https://neon.com/docs/manage/projects#configure-restore-window) that covers the timeframe of interest, allowing for effective use of Time Travel.

## Preparing Your Database

To simulate this scenario, create a `feature_flags` table used for controlling new feature availability.

1. **Create `project_db` Database:**

   In the **Neon Console**, create a new database named `project_db`.

2. **Initialize `feature_flags` Table:**

   Execute the following in the **SQL Editor**, with `product_db` selected as the database:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE feature_flags (
       feature_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
       enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. **Insert Sample Data:**

   Populate the table with an initial feature flag:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO feature_flags (feature_name, enabled)
   VALUES ('new_checkout_process', FALSE);
   ```

This setup reflects a typical development stage: the feature is integrated and deployment-ready but remains inactive, awaiting activation.

## Simulating Feature Flag Activation

Now, we'll simulate the process of enabling this feature flag to release the feature.

### Enable the Feature Flag

Execute the following SQL command in the **SQL Editor** to simulate activating the feature by changing the feature flag's status to `TRUE`.

```sql
UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = TRUE WHERE feature_name = 'new_checkout_process';
```

This action mirrors enabling a new feature in your production environment, typically managed as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

## Determine exactly when the feature was enabled

Since user complaints started coming in right after the feature was enabled, our first debug step is to confirm the exact moment the `new_checkout_process` feature flag was activated. Assume we've checked the deployment logs or CI/CD pipeline history and found the activation timestamp to be `2023-04-09 at 6:11 PM EST`.

For this tutorial, locate the timestamp of the `UPDATE` operation in the **History** tab of the **SQL Editor**:



   **Note**: Timestamps in the Neon Console are shown in your local timezone. The time in this screenshot converts from `2023-04-09 at 6:11:00:00 PM EST` to `2023-04-09 at 10:11:00 PM UTC`.

## Verifying Feature Flag Pre-Activation Status

Let's confirm that the feature was indeed disabled just before the feature flag's activation.

1. Enable the Time Travel toggle in the **SQL Editor**.

1. Enter a time period just before the identified activation timestamp.

   For our purposes, we'll select `2023-04-09 at 18:10 PM EST`, which is one minute before our activation time.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM feature_flags WHERE feature_name = 'new_checkout_process';
   ```

   We'll see the feature flag shows as `f` for false, as expected.

   

## Analyzing Post-Activation State

With the pre-activation state confirmed, now check the feature flag's status immediately after activation.

### Adjust Time Selector to Post-Activation:

Move to a time just after the feature's activation. For example, one minute after the timestamp copied from Step 2, so `2023-04-09 at 6:12 PM EST`. Re-execute the query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM feature_flags WHERE feature_name = 'new_checkout_process';
```



Now, we see the `new_checkout_process` feature flag is `t` for true, confirming that enabling the feature caused the reported issues. With this confirmation we can move on to our follow-up actions: fix the problem, turn off the feature flag, update stakeholders, or engage in a feedback loop with users to refine the feature based on real-world usage.
