This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it from a Rust application.

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection string and password. They are required when defining connection settings.

To create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Configure the connection

   **Note**: To run the Rust solution below you have to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running `cargo add postgres postgres_openssl openssl`. Also, the example provided uses the synchronous `postgres` crate. If your application is asynchronous and uses `tokio`, we recommend using the `tokio-postgres` crate for compatibility with async runtimes.

Add the Neon connection details to your `main.rs` file, as in the following example:

```rust
use postgres::Client;
use openssl::ssl::{SslConnector, SslMethod};
use postgres_openssl::MakeTlsConnector;
use std::error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn error::Error>> {
    let builder = SslConnector::builder(SslMethod::tls())?;
    let connector = MakeTlsConnector::new(builder.build());

    let mut client = Client::connect("postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require", connector)?;

    for row in client.query("SELECT 42", &[])? {
        let ret : i32 = row.get(0);
        println!("Result = {}", ret);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

You can find the connection details for your database by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).
