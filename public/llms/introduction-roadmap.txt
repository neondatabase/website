To learn more, please refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.com/pricing) page and [Plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans) documentation.
- **Data migration support with inbound logical replication**: We've introduced inbound logical replication as the first step toward enabling seamless, low-downtime migrations from your current database provider to Neon. This feature allows you to use Neon as your development environment, taking advantage of developer-friendly tools like branching and our [GitHub integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), even if you keep production with your existing provider. To get started, explore our guides for replicating data from AlloyDB, Aurora, CloudSQL, and RDS. See [Replicate data to Neon](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide#replicate-data-to-neon). Inbound logical replication also supports migrating data between Neon projects, useful for version, region, or account migrations. See [Replicate data from one Neon project to another](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon-to-neon).
