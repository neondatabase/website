- **A new Business plan with more compute and storage**: This new plan provides higher storage and compute allowances (500 GB-month storage and 1,000 compute hours) in addition to all of Neon's advanced features. It also offers potential cost savings for customers requiring more storage than our Scale plan provides. To learn more, please refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.com/pricing) page and [Plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans) documentation.
- **Data migration support with inbound logical replication**: We've introduced inbound logical replication as the first step toward enabling seamless, low-downtime migrations from your current database provider to Neon. This feature allows you to use Neon as your development environment, taking advantage of developer-friendly tools like branching and our [GitHub integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), even if you keep production with your existing provider. To get started, explore our guides for replicating data from AlloyDB, Aurora, CloudSQL, and RDS. See [Replicate data to Neon](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide#replicate-data-to-neon). Inbound logical replication also supports migrating data between Neon projects, useful for version, region, or account migrations. See [Replicate data from one Neon project to another](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon-to-neon).
