# Monitoring Neon with external tools

> The document outlines how to integrate and use external monitoring tools with Neon to track database performance and system metrics effectively.

## Source

- [Monitoring Neon with external tools HTML](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/monitor-external-tools): The original HTML version of this documentation

There are external tools that you can use to monitor your Neon Postgres database, such as [PgHero](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/monitor-external-tools#pghero) and [pgAdmin](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/monitor-external-tools#pgadmin). Setup instructions for those tools are provided below.

   **Note**: Neon does not currently support monitoring tools or platforms that require installing an agent on the Postgres host system, but please keep an eye on our [roadmap](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/roadmap) for future integrations that enable these monitoring options.

## PgHero

[PgHero](https://github.com/pghero/pghero) is an open-source performance tool for Postgres that can help you find and fix data issues, using a dashboard interface.

A quick look at the interface gives you an idea of what you'll find in PgHero.



Among other things, you can use PgHero to:

- Identify long-running queries
- Identify tables that require vacuuming
- Identify duplicate or missing indexes
- View connections by database and user
- Explain, analyze, and visualize queries

#### How to install PgHero

PgHero supports installation with [Docker](https://github.com/ankane/pghero/blob/master/guides/Docker.md), [Linux](https://github.com/ankane/pghero/blob/master/guides/Linux.md), and [Rails](https://github.com/ankane/pghero/blob/master/guides/Rails.md). Here, we'll show how to install PgHero with Docker and connect it to a Neon database.

Before you begin:

- Ensure that you have the [pg_stat_statements](https://neon.com/docs/extensions/pg_stat_statements) extension installed. PgHero uses it for query stats. See above.
- Ensure that you have Docker installed. See [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for instructions.

PgHero is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ankane/pghero/). To install it, run:

```
docker pull ankane/pghero
```

### How to connect to your database from PgHero

Find the connection string for your database by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**.



Finally, run this command, replacing `$NEON_DB` with your Neon database connection string.

```
docker run -ti -e DATABASE_URL='$NEON_DB' -p 8080:8080 ankane/pghero
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser to open the PgHero Dashboard.

## pgAdmin

pgAdmin is a database management tool for Postgres designed to facilitate various database tasks, including monitoring performance metrics.



With pgAdmin, you can monitor real-time activity for a variety of metrics including:

- Active sessions (Total, Active, and Idle)
- Transactions per second (Transactions, Commits, Rollbacks)
- Tuples in (Inserts, Updates, Deletes)
- Tuples out (Fetched, Returned)
- Block I/O for shared buffers (see [Cache your data](https://neon.com/docs/postgresql/query-performance#cache-your-data) for information about Neon's Local File Cache)
- Database activity (Sessions, Locks, Prepared Transactions)

   **Note** Notes: Neon currently does not support the `system_stats` extension required to use the **System Statistics** tab in pgAdmin. It's also important to note that pgAdmin, while active, polls your database for statistics, which does not allow your compute to suspend as it normally would when there is no other database activity.

### How to install pgAdmin

Pre-compiled and configured installation packages for pgAdmin 4 are available for different desktop environments. For installation instructions, refer to the [pgAdmin deployment documentation](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/deployment.html). Downloads can be found on the [PgAdmin Downloads](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) page.

### How to connect to your database from pgAdmin

Find the connection string for your database by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**, as described [above](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/monitor-external-tools#how-to-connect-to-your-database-from-pghero).

Enter your connection details as shown [here](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connect-postgres-gui#connect-to-the-database).

Neon uses the default Postgres port: `5432`
