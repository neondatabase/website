**Neon is Postgres**. However, as a managed Postgres service, there are some differences you should be aware of.

## Postgres versions

Neon supports Postgres 14, 15, 16, 17. You can select the Postgres version you want to use when creating a Neon project. For information about creating a Neon project, See [Manage projects](https://neon.com/docs/manage/projects). Minor Postgres point releases are rolled out by Neon after extensive validation as part of regular platform maintenance.

## Postgres extensions

Neon supports numerous Postgres extensions, and we regularly add support for more. For the extensions that Neon supports, see [Postgres Extensions](https://neon.com/docs/extensions/pg-extensions). To request support for additional extensions, please reach out to us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp). Please keep in mind that privilege requirements, local file system access, and functionality that is incompatible with Neon features such as Autoscaling and Scale to Zero may prevent Neon from being able to offer support for certain extensions.

## Roles and permissions

Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system, and you can't connect using the Postgres `superuser` account. In place of the Postgres superuser role, Neon provides a `neon_superuser` role.

Roles created in the Neon Console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. For information about the privileges associated with this role, see [The neon_superuser role](https://neon.com/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role).

Roles created in Neon with SQL syntax, from a command-line tool like `psql` or the [Neon SQL Editor](https://neon.com/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), have the same privileges as newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These roles are not granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. You must grant these roles the privileges you want them to have. For more information, see [Manage roles with SQL](https://neon.com/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).

Neon roles cannot install Postgres extensions other than those supported by Neon.



## Postgres parameter settings

The following table shows parameter settings that are set explicitly for your Neon Postgres instance. These values may differ from standard Postgres defaults, and a few settings differ based on your Neon compute size.

   **Note**: Because Neon is a managed Postgres service, Postgres parameters are not user-configurable outside of a [session, database, or role context](https://neon.com/docs/reference/compatibility#configuring-postgres-parameters-for-a-session-database-or-role), but if you are a Neon [Scale plan](/docs/introduction/plans) user and require a different Postgres instance-level setting, you can contact [Neon Support](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/support) to see if the desired setting can be supported.

### Parameter settings that differ by compute size

Of the parameter settings listed above, the `max_connections`, `maintenance_work_mem`,
`shared_buffers`, `max_worker_processes`, and `effective_cache_size` differ by your compute size—defined in [Compute Units (CU)](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#compute-unit-cu)—or by your autoscaling configuration, which has a minimum and maximum compute size. To understand how values are set, see the formulas below.

- The formula for `max_connections` is:

  ```go
  compute_size = min(max_compute_size, 8 * min_compute_size)
  max_connections = max(100, min(4000, 450.5 * compute_size))
  ```

  For example, if you have a fixed compute size of 4 CU, that size is both your `max_compute_size` and `min_compute_size`. Inputting that value into the formula gives you a `max_connections` setting of 1802. For an autoscaling configuration with a `min_compute_size` of 0.25 CU and a `max_compute_size` of 2 CU, the `max_connections` setting would be 901.

       **Note**: It's important to note that `max_connections` does not scale dynamically in an autoscaling configuration. It's a static setting determined by your minimum and maximum compute size.

  You can also check your `max_connections` setting in the Neon Console. Go to **Branches**, select your branch, then go to the **Compute** tab and select **Edit**. Your `max_connections` setting is the "direct connections" value. You can adjust the compute configuration to see how it impacts the number of direct connections.

  

  _You can use connection pooling in Neon to increase the number of supported connections. For more information, see [Connection pooling](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connection-pooling)._

- The `maintenance_work_mem` value is set according to your minimum compute size RAM. The formula is:

  ```go
  maintenance_work_mem = max(min_compute_size RAM in bytes * 1024/63,963,136, 65,536)
  ```

  However, you can increase the setting for the current session; for example:

  ```sql
  SET maintenance_work_mem='10 GB';
  ```

  If you do increase `maintenance_work_mem`, your setting should not exceed 60 percent of your compute's available RAM.

- The formula for `max_worker_processes` is:

  ```go
  max_worker_processes := 12 + floor(2 * max_compute_size)
  ```

  For example, if your `max_compute_size` is 4 CU, your `max_worker_processes` setting would be 20.

- The formula for `shared_buffers` is:

  ```go
  backends = 1 + max_connections + max_worker_processes
  shared_buffers_mb = max(128, (1023 + backends * 256) / 1024)
  ```

- The `effective_cache_size` parameter is set based on the [Local File Cache (LFC)](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#local-file-cache) size of your maximum Neon compute size. This helps the Postgres query planner make smarter decisions, which can improve query performance. For details on LFC size by compute size, see the table in [How to size your compute](https://neon.com/docs/manage/computes#how-to-size-your-compute).

### Configuring Postgres parameters for a session, database, or role

Neon permits configuring parameters that have a `user` context, meaning that these parameters can be set for a session, database, or role. You can identify Postgres parameters with a `user` context by running the following query:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM pg_settings
WHERE context = 'user';
```

To set a parameter for a specific session, use a [SET](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-set.html) command.

For example, the `maintenance_work_mem` parameter supports a `user` context, which lets you set it for the current session with a `SET` command:

```sql
SET maintenance_work_mem='1 GB';
```

To set parameters for a database or role:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE neondb SET maintenance_work_mem='1 GB';
```

```sql
ALTER USER neondb_owner SET maintenance_work_mem='1 GB';
```

## Postgres logs

PostgreSQL logs can be accessed through the [Datadog integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/datadog) on Scale tier and higher plans. The integration forwards logs including error messages, database connection events, system notifications, and general PostgreSQL logs. For other plans or if you need specific log information for troubleshooting purposes, please contact [Neon Support](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/support).

## Unlogged tables

Unlogged tables are maintained on Neon compute local storage. These tables do not survive compute restarts (including when a Neon compute is placed into an idle state after a period of inactivity). This is unlike a standalone Postgres installation, where unlogged tables are only truncated in the event of abnormal process termination. Additionally, unlogged tables are limited by compute local disk space. Neon computes allocate 20 GiB of local disk space or 15 GiB x the maximum compute size (whichever is highest) for temporary files used by Postgres.

## Memory

SQL queries and index builds can generate large volumes of data that may not fit in memory. In Neon, the size of your compute determines the amount of memory that is available. For information about compute size and available memory, see [How to size your compute](https://neon.com/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

## Temporary tables

Temporary tables, which are stored in compute local storage, are limited by compute local storage size.

## Session context

The Neon cloud service automatically closes idle connections after a period of inactivity, as described in [Compute lifecycle](https://neon.com/docs/conceptual-guides/compute-lifecycle/). When connections are closed, anything that exists within a session context is forgotten and must be recreated before being used again. For example, parameters set for a specific session, in-memory statistics, temporary tables, prepared statements, advisory locks, and notifications and listeners defined using [NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-notify.html)/[LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html) commands only exist for the duration of the current session and are lost when the session ends. To avoid losing session-level contexts in Neon, you can disable Neon's [Scale to Zero](https://neon.com/docs/guides/scale-to-zero-guide) feature, which is possible on any of Neon's paid plans. However, disabling scale to zero also means that your compute will run 24/7. You can't disable scale to zero on Neon's Free plan, where your compute always suspends after 5 minutes of inactivity.

## Statistics collection

Statistics collected by the Postgres [cumulative statistics system](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html) are not saved when a Neon compute (where Postgres runs) is suspended due to inactivity or restarted. For information about the lifecycle of a Neon compute, see [Compute lifecycle](https://neon.com/docs/conceptual-guides/compute-lifecycle/). For information about configuring Neon's scale to zero behavior, see [Scale to Zero](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/scale-to-zero).

## Database encoding

Neon supports UTF8 encoding (Unicode, 8-bit variable-width encoding). This is the most widely used and recommended encoding for Postgres.

To view the encoding and collation for your database, you can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    pg_database.datname AS database_name,
    pg_encoding_to_char(pg_database.encoding) AS encoding,
    pg_database.datcollate AS collation,
    pg_database.datctype AS ctype
FROM
    pg_database
WHERE
    pg_database.datname = 'your_database_name';
```

You can also issue this command from [psql](https://neon.com/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) or the Neon SQL Editor:

```bash
\l
```

   **Note**: In Postgres, you cannot change a database's encoding or collation after it has been created.

## Collation support

A collation is an SQL schema object that maps an SQL name to locales provided by libraries installed in the operating system. A collation has a provider that specifies which library supplies the locale data. For example, a common standard provider, `libc`, uses locales provided by the operating system C library.

By default, Neon uses the `C.UTF-8` collation. `C.UTF-8` supports the full range of UTF-8 encoded characters.

Another provider supported by Neon is `icu`, which uses the external [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org/) library. In Neon, support for standard `libc` locales is limited compared to what you might find in a locally installed Postgres instance where there's typically a wider range of locales provided by libraries installed on your operating system. For this reason, Neon provides a full series of [predefined icu locales](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/collation.html#COLLATION-MANAGING-PREDEFINED-ICU) in case you require locale-specific sorting or case conversions.

To view all of the predefined locales available to you, use the query `SELECT * FROM pg_collation`, or the command `\dOS+` from the [Neon SQL Editor](https://neon.com/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) or an SQL client like [psql](https://neon.com/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

To create a database with a predefined `icu` locale, you can issue a query similar to this one with your preferred locale:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_arabic_db
LOCALE_PROVIDER icu
icu_locale 'ar-x-icu'
template template0;
```

To specify the locale for individual columns, you can use this syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_ru_table (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    russian_text_column text COLLATE "ru-x-icu",
    description text
);
```

ICU also supports creating custom collations. For more information, see [ICU Custom Collations](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/collation.html#ICU-CUSTOM-COLLATIONS).

For more about collations in Postgres, see [Collation Support](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/collation.html#COLLATION).
