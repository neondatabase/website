# Glossary

> The "Glossary" document defines key terms and concepts relevant to Neon's database platform, aiding users in understanding specific terminology used within Neon's technical documentation.

## Source

- [Glossary HTML](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary): The original HTML version of this documentation

## access token

See [Token](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#token).

## active hours

A usage metric that tracks the amount of time a compute is active, rather than idle when suspended due to inactivity. The time that your compute is idle is not counted toward compute usage.

Also see [Compute hours](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#compute-hours).

## Activity Monitor

A process that monitors a Neon compute for activity. During periods of inactivity, the Activity Monitor gracefully places the compute into an idle state to save energy and resources. The Activity Monitor closes idle connections after 5 minutes of inactivity. When a connection is made to an idle compute, the Activity Monitor reactivates the compute.

## Admin

An [Organizations](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#organization) role in Neon with full access to all projects, permissions, invitations, and billing for an organization. Admins can manage members, assign roles, set permissions, and delete the organization.

## API

See [Neon API](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#neon-api).

## API Key

A unique identifier used to authenticate a user or a calling program to an API. An API key is required to authenticate to the Neon API. For more information, see [Manage API keys](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys).

## apply_config

A Neon Control Plane operation that applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, creating, deleting, or updating Postgres users and databases initiates this operation. See [System operations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## Archive storage

Cost-efficient storage where Neon archives inactive branches after a defined threshold. For Neon projects created in AWS regions, inactive branches are archived in Amazon S3 storage. For Neon projects created in Azure regions, branches are archived in Azure Blob storage.

## autoscaler-agent

A control mechanism in the Neon autoscaling system that collects metrics from VMs, makes scaling decisions, and performs checks and requests to implement those decisions.

## Autoscaling

A feature that automatically adjusts the allocation of vCPU and RAM for compute within specified minimum and maximum compute size boundaries, optimizing for performance and cost-efficiency. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

## Availability Checker

A periodic load generated by the Control Plane to determine if a compute can start and read and write data. The Availability Checker queries a system database without accessing user data. You can monitor these checks, how long they take, and how often they occur, on the **Systems operations** tab on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console.

## backpressure

A mechanism that manages the lag between the Pageserver and compute node or the Pageserver and Write-Ahead Log (WAL) service. If the WAL service runs ahead of the Pageserver, the time to serve page requests increases, which could result in increased query times or timeout errors. The backpressure mechanism manages lag using a stop-and-wait backend throttling strategy.

## backup branch

A branch created by a [instant restore](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#branch-restore) operation. When you restore a branch from a particular point in time, the current branch is saved as a backup branch.

## branch

An isolated copy of data, similar to a Git branch. Data includes databases, schemas, tables, records, indexes, roles — everything that comprises data in a Postgres instance. Just as a Git branch allows developers to work on separate features or fixes without impacting their main line of code, a Neon branch enables users to modify a copy of their data in isolation from their main line of data. This approach facilitates parallel database development, testing, and other features, similar to Git's code branching system.

Each Neon project is created with two branches by default:

- **production** - The default branch. This main line of data is referred to as [root branch](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#root-branch).
- **development** - A child branch of production. A branch created from the root branch or another branch is a [copy-on-write](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#copy-on-write) clone.

You can create a branch from the current or past state of another branch. A branch created from the current state of another branch includes the data that existed on that branch at the time of branch creation. A branch created from a past state of another branch includes the data that existed in the past state.

Connecting to a database on a branch requires connecting via a compute attached to the branch. See [Connect to a branch](https://neon.com/docs/manage/branches#connect-to-a-branch).

## branch archiving

The automatic archiving of inactive branches in cost-efficient archive storage after a defined threshold. For more, see [Branch archiving](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-archiving).

## Branching

A Neon feature that allows you to create an isolated copy of your data for parallel database development, testing, and other purposes, similar to branching in Git. See [Branch](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#branch).

### Business plan

A paid plan offered by Neon designed for mid-to-large enterprises that require higher compute capacity and advanced security and compliance features. See [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans).

## check_availability

A Neon Control Plane operation that checks the availability of data in a branch and that a compute can start on a branch. Branches without a compute are not checked. This operation, performed by the availability checker, is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane. You can monitor these checks, how long they take, and how often they occur, on the **Systems operations** tab on the **Monitoring** page in the Neon Console.

## CI/CD

Continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment.

## CIDR notation

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a method used to define ranges of IP addresses in network management. It is presented in the format of an IP address, followed by a slash, and then a number (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24). The number after the slash represents the size of the address block, providing a compact way to specify a large range of IP addresses. In Neon's IP Allow feature, CIDR notation allows for efficiently specifying a block of IP addresses, especially useful for larger networks or subnets. This can be advantageous when managing access to branches with numerous potential users, such as in a large development team or a company-wide network. For related information, see [Configure IP Allow](https://neon.com/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## cgroups

Control groups, a Linux kernel feature that allows the organization, prioritization, and accounting of system resources for groups of processes.

## Collaborator

A role in Neon with limited access to specific projects shared with them. Shared projects appear under the "Shared with you" section in their personal account.

## Compute

A service that provides virtualized computing resources, equipped with an operating system, a specified number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs), and a defined amount of RAM. It provides the processing power and resources for running applications. In the context of Neon, a compute runs Postgres and includes supporting components and extensions.

A [compute endpoint](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#compute-endpoint) is the access point for connecting to a Neon compute.

Neon creates a primary read-write compute for the project's default branch. Neon supports both read-write and [read replica](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/read-replicas) computes. A branch can have a single primary (read-write) compute but supports multiple read replica computes. The compute hostname is required to connect to a Neon Postgres database from a client or application.

## compute endpoint

The network access point for connecting to a [Neon compute](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#compute).

In Neon, a compute endpoint is represented by a hostname, such as `ep-aged-math-668285.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`, which directs traffic to the appropriate Neon compute. Additional attributes further define a compute endpoint, including `project_id`, `region_id`, `branch_id`, and `type`. These attributes specify the associated Neon project, branch, cloud service region, and whether the endpoint is read-write or read-only. For additional endpoint attributes, refer to the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint).

## compute size

The Compute Units (CU) that are allocated to a Neon compute. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 to 56 CU. The number of units determines the processing capacity of the compute.

## Compute Unit (CU)

A unit that measures the processing power or "size" of a Neon compute. A Compute Unit (CU) includes vCPU and RAM. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 to 56 CUs. See [Compute size and autoscaling configuration](https://neon.com/docs/manage/computes#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).

## compute hours

A usage metric for tracking compute usage. 1 compute hour is equal to 1 [active hour](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#active-hours) for a compute with 1 vCPU. If you have a compute with .25 vCPU, as you would on the Neon Free Plan, it would require 4 _active hours_ to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if you have a compute with 4 vCPU, it would only take 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour.

To calculate compute hour usage, you would use the following formula:

```
compute hours = compute size * active hours
```

For more information, see [Compute](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#compute).

Also see [Active hours](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#active-hours).

## connection pooling

A method of creating a pool of connections and caching those connections for reuse. Neon supports `PgBouncer` in `transaction mode` for connection pooling. For more information, see [Connection pooling](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

## connection string

A string containing details for connecting to a Neon Postgres database. The details include a user name (role), compute hostname, and database name; for example:

```bash
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

The compute hostname includes an `endpoint_id` (`ep-cool-darkness-123456`), a region slug (`c-2.us-east-2`), the cloud platform (`aws`), and Neon domain (`neon.tech`). Connection strings in some AWS regions may include a cell identifier (e.g., `c-2`) in the region slug to support scalability in Neon's high-demand regions.

Connection strings for a Neon databases can be obtained by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**. For information about connecting to Neon, see [Connect from any application](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## console

See [Neon Console](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#neon-console).

## Control Plane

The part of the Neon architecture that manages cloud storage and compute resources.

## copy-on-write

A technique used to copy data efficiently. Neon uses the copy-on-write technique when creating [branches](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#branch). When a branch is created, data is marked as shared rather than physically duplicated. Parent and child branches refer to the same physical data resource. Data is only physically copied when a write occurs. The affected portion of data is copied and the write is performed on the copied data.

## create_branch

A Neon Control Plane operation that creates a branch in a Neon project. For related information, see Manage branches. See [System operations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## create_timeline

Sets up storage and creates the default branch when a Neon [project](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#project) is created. See [System operations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## data-at-rest encryption

A method of storing inactive data that converts plaintext data into a coded form or cipher text, making it unreadable without an encryption key. Neon stores inactive data in [NVMe SSD volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html#nvme-ssd-volumes). The data on NVMe instance storage is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance.

## Data transfer

A usage metric that measures the total volume of data transferred out of Neon (egress) during a billing period. Egress also includes data transferred from Neon via Postgres logical replication to any destination, including Neon itself. Neon does not charge for data transfer, but Free Plan projects are limited to 5 GB per month. See [Data transfer](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#data-transfer).

## Database

A named collection of database objects. A Neon project is created with a database that resides in the default `public` schema. If you do not specify a name for the database when creating a Neon project, it's created with the name `neondb`. A Neon project can contain multiple databases. Users cannot manipulate system databases, such as the `postgres`, `template0`, or `template1` databases.

## database branching

See [Branching](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#branching).

## database fleet

A collection of database instances, typically managed as a single entity.

## decoder plugin

Utilized in PostgreSQL replication architecture to decode WAL entries into a format understandable by the subscriber. The `pgoutput` decoder plugin is the default decoder, with alternatives like `wal2json` for specific use cases. Neon supports `pgoutput` and `wal2json`. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## dedicated resources

Resources including compute and storage dedicated to a single Neon account.

## delete_tenant

A Neon Control Plane operation that deletes stored data when a Neon project is deleted. See [System operations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## Endpoint ID

A string that identifies a Neon compute endpoint. Neon Endpoint IDs are generated Heroku-like memorable random names, similar to `ep-calm-flower-a5b75h79`. These names are always prefixed by `ep` for "endpoint". You can find your Endpoint ID by navigating to your project in the Neon Console, selecting **Branches** from the sidebar, and clicking on a branch. The **Endpoint ID** is shown in the table under the **Computes** heading.

## Egress

The data transferred out of the Neon service to an external destination. See [Data transfer](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#data-transfer).

## Enterprise plan

A custom volume-based paid plan offered by Neon. See [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans).

## Free Plan

See [Neon Free Plan](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#neon-free-plan).

## GB-month

In Neon, **GB-month** is a unit of measure representing the storage of 1 gigabyte (GB) of data for one month. A gigabyte is defined as 10^9 bytes (1,000,000,000 bytes). Storage usage is measured periodically and accumulated over the billing period. At the start of each billing period, GB-month usage resets to zero.

GB-month usage reflects both the amount of storage used and how long it was used. For example, storing 10 GB for an entire month results in **10 GB-months**, while storing 10 GB for half a month results in **5 GB-months**.

Deleting data will reduce the rate at which GB-month usage increases from that point forward, but it does not decrease the GB-month usage accrued up to that point.

## History

The history of data changes for all branches in your Neon project. A history is maintained to support _instant restore_. For more information, see [Storage details](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#storage-details).

## Instant restore

Restoration of data to a state that existed at an earlier time. Neon retains a history of changes in the form of Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) records, which allows you to restore data to an earlier point. A instant restore is performed by creating a branch using the **Time** or **LSN** option.

By default, Neon retains a history of changes for **1 day** across all plans to help avoid unexpected storage costs. You can increase the retention window to 24 hours for [Neon Free Plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan) users, 7 days for [Launch](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#launch), 14 days for [Scale](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#scale), and 30 days for [Business](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#business) plan users. Keep in mind that this will increase your storage usage and may lead to higher costs, especially if you have many active branches.

For more information about this feature, see [Branching — Instant restore](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branch-restore).

## IP Allow

A Neon feature used to control which IP addresses can access databases in a Neon project, often utilized to restrict public internet access. See [IP Allow](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/ip-allow).

## IP allowlist

An IP allowlist is a security measure used in network and database management. It specifies a list of IP addresses that are permitted to access a certain resource. Any IP address not on the list is automatically blocked, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can gain access. In Neon, **IP Allow** is a [Scale](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#scale) and [Business](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#business) plan feature that can be used to control access to the branch where your database resides. For more information, see [Configure the IP Allow list](https://neon.com/docs/manage/projects#configure-tip-allow).

## Kubernetes

An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Kubernetes cluster

A set of interconnected nodes that run containerized applications and services using Kubernetes, an open-source orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The cluster consists of at least one control plane node, which manages the overall state of the cluster, and multiple worker nodes, where the actual application containers are deployed and executed. The worker nodes communicate with the control plane node to ensure the desired state of the applications is maintained.

## Kubernetes node

A worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster, which runs containerized applications.

## Kubernetes scheduler

A component of Kubernetes that assigns newly created pods to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.

## KVM

Kernel-based Virtual Machine, a virtualization infrastructure built into the Linux kernel that allows it to act as a hypervisor for virtual machines.

## Launch plan

A paid plan offered by Neon that provides all of the resources, features, and support you need to launch your application. It's ideal for startups and growing businesses or applications. See [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans).

## live migration

A feature provided by some hypervisors, such as QEMU, that allows the transfer of a running virtual machine from one host to another with minimal interruption.

## Local File Cache

The Local File Cache (LFC) is a layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data from the storage layer in the local memory of the compute. This cache helps to reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from the storage layer repeatedly. The LFC acts as an add-on or extension of Postgres [shared buffers](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#shared-buffers). In Neon the `shared_buffers` parameter [scales with compute size](https://neon.com/docs/reference/compatibility#parameter-settings-that-differ-by-compute-size). The LFC extends cache memory up to 75 % of your compute's RAM.

### logical data size

For a Postgres database, it is the size of the database, including all tables, indexes, views, and stored procedures. In Neon, a branch can have multiple databases. The logical data size for a branch is therefore equal to the total logical size of all databases on the branch.

## logical replication

A method of replicating data between databases or platforms, focusing on replicating transactional changes (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) rather than the entire database, enabling selective replication of specific tables or rows. Neon supports logical replication of data to external destinations. See [Logical replication](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide).

## LSN

Log Sequence Number. A byte offset to a location in the [WAL stream](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#wal-stream). The Neon branching feature supports creating branches with data up to a specified LSN.

## LRU policy

Least Recently Used policy, an algorithm for cache replacement that evicts the least recently accessed items first.

## Monitoring Dashboard

A feature of the Neon Console that provides several graphs to help you monitor system and database metrics, updated in real time based on your usage data.

## Member

An [Organizations](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#organization) role in Neon with access to all projects within the organization. Members cannot manage billing, members, or permissions. They must be invited to the organization by an [Admin](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#admin).

## Neon

A serverless Postgres platform designed to help developers build reliable and scalable applications faster. We separate compute and storage to offer modern developer features such as autoscaling, branching, instant restore, and more. For more information, see [Why Neon?](https://neon.com/docs/introduction).

## Neon API

The Neon RESTful Application Programming Interface. Any operation performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API.

## Neon Console

A browser-based graphical interface for managing Neon projects and resources.

## Neon Free Plan

A Neon service plan for which there are no usage charges. For information about the Neon Free Plan and associated limits, see [Neon Free Plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#free-plan).

## Neon Proxy

A component of the Neon platform that acts as an intermediary between connecting clients and compute nodes where Postgres runs. The Neon Proxy is responsible for tasks such as connection routing, authentication, and metrics collection. From a security perspective, it helps protect the integrity of the Neon platform through a combination of authentication, authorization, and other security measures.

## Neon user

The user account that registers and authenticates with Neon using an email, GitHub, Google, or partner account. After authenticating, a Neon user account can create and manage projects, branches, users, databases, and other project resources.

## Neon Org

A named organization entity in Neon that groups multiple Neon users under a shared account. See [Organization](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#organization) for details.

## NeonVM

A QEMU-based tool used by Neon to create and manage VMs within a Kubernetes cluster, allowing for the allocation and deallocation of vCPU and RAM. For more information, refer to the NeonVM source in the [neondatabase/autoscaling](https://github.com/neondatabase/autoscaling/tree/main/neonvm) repository.

## non-default branch

Any branch in a Neon project that is not designated as the [default branch](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#default-branch). For more information, see [Non-default branch](https://neon.com/docs/manage/branches#non-default-branch).

## Organization

A feature in Neon that enables teams to collaborate on projects under a shared account. Organizations provide centralized management for billing, user roles, and project collaboration. Members can be invited to join, and roles such as Admin, Member, and Collaborator determine access and permissions within the organization.

Admins oversee all aspects of the organization, including managing members, permissions, billing, and projects. Members have access to all organizational projects but cannot manage billing or members. Collaborators have limited access to specific projects shared with them and do not have access to the organization dashboard.

Organizations are available on paid plans and can be created from scratch or by converting a personal account into an organization. For more, see [Organizations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/organizations).

## Page

An 8KB unit of data, which is the smallest unit that Postgres uses for storing relations and indexes on disk. In Neon, a page is also the smallest unit of data that resides on a Pageserver. For information about Postgres page format, see [Database Page Layout](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/storage-page-layout.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

## Paid plan

A paid Neon service plan. See [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans).

## Pageserver

A Neon architecture component that reads WAL records from Safekeepers to identify modified pages. The Pageserver accumulates and indexes incoming WAL records in memory and writes them to disk in batches. Each batch is written to an immutable file that is never modified after creation. Using these files, the Pageserver can quickly reconstruct any version of a page dating back to the defined restore window. Neon retains a history for all branches.

The Pageserver uploads immutable files to cloud storage, which is the final, highly durable destination for data. After a file is successfully uploaded to cloud storage, the corresponding WAL records can be removed from the Safekeepers.

## passwordless authentication

The ability to authenticate without providing a password. Neon's [Passwordless auth](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#passwordless-auth) feature supports passwordless authentication.

## peak usage

Peak usage is the highest amount of a resource (like storage or projects) you've used during the current billing period. If you go over your plan's limit, extra charges are added in set increments. You're charged for these extra units from the date you went over the limit, with the charges prorated for the rest of the month.

## point-in-time restore (PITR)

A database recovery capability that allows restoring data to a specific moment in the past using Write-Ahead Log (WAL) records. In Neon, this capability is implemented through the instant restore feature, which performs point-in-time restores with near-zero delay.

## pooled connection string

A pooled connection string in Neon includes a `-pooler` option, which directs your connection to a pooled connection port at the Neon Proxy. This is an example of a pooled connection:

```text
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

A pooled connection can support a high number of concurrent users and is recommended for use with serverless and edge functions. For more information, see [Connection pooling](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

You can obtain a pooled connection string for your database by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**. Select the **Connection pooling** option to add the `-pooler` option to the connection string. For further instructions, see [How to use connection pooling](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connection-pooling#how-to-use-connection-pooling).

## PostgreSQL

An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

## Postgres role

A Postgres role is an entity that can own database objects and has privileges to perform database actions.

A Postgres role named `neondb_owner` is created with each Neon project by default. This role owns the ready-to-use `neondb` database, also created by default with each new Neon project. This role and any additional role created in the Neon Console, API, or CLI is assigned the [neon_superuser](https://neon.com/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which allows creating databases, roles, and reading and writing data in all tables, views, sequences. Roles created with SQL are created with the same basic [public schema privileges](https://neon.com/docs/manage/database-access#public-schema-privileges) granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users are not assigned the `neon_superuser` role. They must be selectively granted permissions for each database object. For more information, see [Manage database access](https://neon.com/docs/manage/database-access).

Older projects may have a `web-access` system role, used by the [SQL Editor](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#sql-editor) and Neon's [Passwordless auth](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#passwordless-auth). The `web-access` role is system-managed. It cannot be modified, removed, or used in other authentication scenarios.

## Private Networking

A feature in Neon that allows secure connections to Neon databases through AWS PrivateLink, bypassing the open internet. This ensures all data traffic remains within AWS's private network for enhanced security and compliance. See [Private Networking](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-private-networking).

## default branch

A designation that is given to a [branch](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#branch) in a Neon project. Each Neon project is initially created with a [root branch](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#root-branch) called `production`, which carries the _default branch_ designation by default.

The default branch has a larger compute hour allowance on the Free Plan. For users on paid plans, the compute associated with the default branch is exempt from the limit on simultaneously active computes, ensuring that it is always available.

You can change your default branch, but a branch carrying the default branch designation cannot be deleted.

For more information, see [default branch](https://neon.com/docs/manage/branches#default-branch).

## Project

A collection of branches, databases, roles, and other project resources and settings. A project contains a primary [compute](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#compute) that runs Postgres. It may also include [read replicas](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#read-replica). A Neon account may have multiple projects.

## Project ID

A string that identifies your Neon project. Neon Project IDs are generated Heroku-like memorable random names, similar to `cool-forest-86753099`. You can find your project ID by navigating to your project in the Neon Console and selecting **Settings** from the sidebar. The project ID is also visible in the Neon Console URL after navigating to a project: `https://console.neon.tech/app/projects/cool-forest-86753099`

## Project Collaboration

A feature that lets you invite other Neon users to work on a project together. Note that organization members don't need to be added as collaborators since they automatically get access to all organization projects. See [Invite collaborators](https://neon.com/docs/manage/projects#invite-collaborators-to-a-project) for more information.

## Project storage

The total volume of data stored in your Neon project. Also, a billing metric that measures the total volume of data and history, in GB-hours, stored in your Neon project. See [Storage](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#storage).

## prorate

Adjusting a payment or charge so it corresponds to the actual usage or time period involved, rather than charging a full amount. Neon prorates the cost for extra units of storage when you exceed your plan's allowance. For example, if you purchase an extra unit of storage halfway through the monthly billing period, you are only charged half the unit price.

## Proxy

A Neon component that functions as a multitenant service that accepts and handles connections from clients that use the Postgres protocol.

## Protected Branches

A feature in Neon you can use to designate a Neon branch as "protected", which enables a series of protections:

- Protected branches cannot be deleted.
- Protected branches cannot be [reset](https://neon.com/docs/manage/branches#reset-a-branch-from-parent).
- Projects with protected branches cannot be deleted.
- Computes associated with a protected branch cannot be deleted.
- New passwords are automatically generated for Postgres roles on branches created from protected branches. [See below](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#new-passwords-generated-for-postgres-roles-on-child-branches).
- With additional configuration steps, you can apply IP Allow restrictions to protected branches only. The [IP Allow](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/ip-allow) feature is available on the Neon [Scale](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#scale) and [Business](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#business) plans. See [below](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#how-to-apply-ip-restrictions-to-protected-branches).
- Protected branches are not [archived](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-archiving) due to inactivity.

The protected branches feature is available on all Neon paid plans. Typically, the protected branch status is given to a branch or branches that hold production data or sensitive data. For information about how to configure a protected branch, refer to our [Protected branches guide](https://neon.com/docs/guides/protected-branches).

## Publisher

In the context of logical replication, the publisher is the primary data source where changes occur. It's responsible for sending those changes to one or more subscribers. A Neon database can act as a publisher in a logical replication setup. See [Logical replication](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide).

## QEMU

A free and open-source emulator and virtualizer that performs hardware virtualization.

## RAM

Random Access Memory, a type of computer memory used to store data that is being actively processed.

## read replica

A read replica in Neon is a compute instance that connects to the same underlying storage as the primary compute but operates in read-only mode. It lets you offload read queries from your primary compute to improve performance and scalability, especially for analytical or reporting workloads. Read replica computes can be added or removed without affecting the primary compute.

## region

The geographic location where Neon project resources are located. Neon supports creating projects in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure regions. For information about regions supported by Neon, see [Regions](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/regions).

## replication slot

On the publisher database in a logical replication setup, replication slots track the progress of replication to ensure no data in the WAL is purged before the subscriber has successfully replicated it, thus preventing data loss or inconsistency. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## resale

Selling the Neon service as part of another service offering. Neon's Platform Partnership plan offers resale of the Neon service as an option. See [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans) for more information.

## root branch

A branch with no parent. Each Neon project starts with a root branch named `production`, which cannot be deleted and is set as the [default branch](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#default-branch) for the project.

Neon also supports two other types of root branches that have no parent but _can_ be deleted:

- [Backup branches](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#backup-branch), created by instant restore operations on other root branches.
- [Schema-only branches](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#schema-only-branch).

The number of root branches allowed in a project depends on your Neon plan.

## Safekeeper

A Neon architecture component responsible for the durability of database changes. Postgres streams WAL records to Safekeepers. A quorum algorithm based on Paxos ensures that when a transaction is committed, it is stored on a majority of Safekeepers and can be recovered if a node is lost. Safekeepers are deployed in different availability zones to ensure high availability and durability.

## Scale plan

A paid plan offered by Neon that provides full platform and support access. It's designed for scaling production workloads. See [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans).

## Scale to Zero

A Neon feature that suspends a compute after a specified period of inactivity (5 minutes by default) to minimize compute usage. When suspended, a compute is placed into an idle state. Otherwise, the compute is in an `Active` state. Users on paid plans can disable the _Scale to Zero_ feature for an "always-active" compute. For more information, see [Edit a compute](https://neon.com/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute).

## schema-only branch

A branch that replicates only the database schema from a source branch, without copying any of the actual data. This feature is particularly valuable when working with sensitive information. Rather than creating branches that include confidential data, you can duplicate just the database structure and then populate it with your own data.

Schema-only branches are [root branches](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#root-branch), meaning they have no parent. As a root branch, each schema-only branch starts an independent line of data in a Neon project.

See [Schema-only branches](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branching-schema-only).

## Schema Diff

A Neon feature that lets you compare database schemas between different branches for better debugging, code review, and team collobration. See [Schema Diff](https://neon.com/docs/guides/schema-diff).

## serverless

A cloud-based development model that enables developing and running applications without having to manage servers.

## shared buffers

A memory area in Postgres for caching blocks of data from storage (disk on standalone Postgres or Pageservers in Neon). This cache enhances the performance of database operations by reducing the need to access the slower storage for frequently accessed data. Neon uses a [Local File Cache (LFC)](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#local-file-cache), which acts as an add-on or extension of shared buffers. In Neon the `shared_buffers` parameter [scales with compute size](https://neon.com/docs/reference/compatibility#parameter-settings-that-differ-by-compute-size). The LFC extends cache memory up to 75 % of your compute's RAM. For additional information about shared buffers in Postgres, see [Resource Consumption](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html), in the Postgres documentation.

## SNI

Server Name Indication. A TLS protocol extension that allows a client or browser to indicate which hostname it wants to connect to at the beginning of a TLS handshake.

## SQL Editor

A feature of the Neon Console that enables running queries on a Neon database. The SQL Editor also enables saving queries, viewing query history, and analyzing or explaining queries.

## start_compute

A Neon Control Plane operation that starts a compute when there is an event or action that requires compute resources. For example, connecting to a suspended compute initiates this operation. See [System operations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations) for more information. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see [Compute lifecycle](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle).

## Storage

Where data is recorded and stored. Neon storage consists of Pageservers, which store hot data, and a cloud object store, such as Amazon S3, that stores cold data for cost optimization and durability.

Also, a usage metric that tracks the total volume of data and [history](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#history) stored in Neon. For more information, see [Storage](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#storage).

## subscriber

The database or platform receiving changes from the publisher in a logical replication setup. It applies changes received from the publisher to its own data set. Currently, a Neon database can only act as a publisher in a logical replication setup. See [Logical replication](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide).

## subscription

Represents the downstream side of logical replication, establishing a connection to the publisher and subscribing to one or more publications to receive updates. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## suspend_compute

A Neon Control Plane operation that suspends a compute after a period of inactivity. See [System operations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations) for more information. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see [Compute lifecycle](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle).

## technical preview

An early version of a feature or changes released for testing and feedback purposes.

## tenant_attach

A Neon Control Plane operation that attaches a Neon project to storage. For example, this operation occurs when you create a new Neon project. See [System operations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## tenant_detach

A Neon Control Plane operation that detaches a Neon project from storage. For example, this operation occurs after the project as been idle for 30 days. See [System operations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## tenant_reattach

A Neon Control Plane operation that reattaches a Neon project to storage. For example, this operation occurs when a detached Neon project receives a request. See [System operations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## token

An encrypted access token that enables you to authenticate with Neon using the Neon API. An access token is generated when creating a Neon API key. For more information, see [Manage API keys](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys).

## unpooled connection string

An unpooled connection string connects to your Neon database directly. It does not use [connection pooling](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#connection-pooling), and it looks similar to this:

```text
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

You can obtain an unpooled connection string for your database by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard**. Ensure that the **Connection pooling** option is **not** selected. A direct connection is subject to the `max_connections` limit for your compute. For more information, see [How to size your compute](https://neon.com/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

## Time Travel

A Neon feature that lets you connect to any selected point in time within your restore window and run queries against that connection. See [Time Travel](https://neon.com/docs/guides/time-travel-assist).

## user

See [Neon user](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#neon-user) and [Postgres role](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#postgresql-role).

## vm-monitor

A program that runs inside the VM alongside Postgres, responsible for requesting more resources from the autoscaler-agent and validating proposed downscaling to ensure sufficient memory.

## vCPU

Virtual CPU, a unit of processing power allocated to a virtual machine or compute.

## WAL

See [Write-Ahead Logging](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#write-ahead-logging-wal).

## WAL receiver

In logical replication, on the subscriber side, the WAL receiver is a process that receives the replication stream (decoded WAL data) and applies these changes to the subscriber's database. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## WAL sender

In logical replication, the WAL sender is a process on the publisher database that reads the WAL and sends relevant data to the subscriber. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## WAL slice

Write-ahead logs in a specific LSN range.

## WAL stream

The stream of data written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during transactional processing.

## working set

A subset of frequently accessed or recently used data and indexes that ideally reside in memory (RAM) for quick access, allowing for better performance. See [how to size your compute](https://neon.com/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute) to learn how to set your minimum compute to an adequate size to handle your working set.

## Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

A standard mechanism that ensures the durability of your data. Neon relies on WAL to separate storage and compute, and to support features such as branching and instant restore.

In logical replication, the WAL records all changes to the data, serving as the source for data that needs to be replicated.

## Written data

A usage metric that measures the total volume of data written from compute to storage within a given billing period, measured in gigabytes (GB). Writing data from compute to storage ensures the durability and integrity of your data.
