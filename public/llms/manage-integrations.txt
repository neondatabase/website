The **Integrations** page in the Neon Console provides a hub for managing third-party integrations with your Neon project. You can use these supported integrations to optimize and extend Neon's functionality and streamline your workflow.

When visiting the **Integrations** page, you'll notice different categories of integrations, which you can browse to find the one you need.

## Manage integrations

For integrations listed as **Added**, you can click **Manage** on the integration card to configure or remove the integration.

## Add integrations

For integrations that are not added, you can click **Add** and follow the instructions to get started. Some integrations support an automated integration setup. Others are documented integrations, which involve a manual setup procedure.

## Manual integrations

Integrations currently requiring a manual setup have a **Read** button, which opens a modal where you can read about how to integrate the selected platform or service with Neon.

## Express interest in future integrations

Integrations that are not yet available have a **Request** button, which opens a modal where you can express your interest and share your use case. This information helps the Neon team prioritize integration rollouts and build exactly what you need.

## Suggest an integration

If you can't find the integration you're looking for:

1. Click the **Suggest an integration** button on the **Integrations** page.
2. Fill out the necessary details for the integration you'd like to see added.
3. Click **Suggest integration**.

The Neon team will review your request.
