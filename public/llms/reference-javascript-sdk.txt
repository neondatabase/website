The Neon JavaScript SDK (`@neondatabase/neon-js`) provides authentication and database operations for your applications.

Authentication is provided through an adapter-based architecture, letting you work more easily with your existing code or preferred framework. Available adapters:

- **BetterAuthVanillaAdapter** (default) — Promise-based authentication methods like `client.auth.signIn.email()`. Used in all examples on this page.
- **BetterAuthReactAdapter** — Similar API but with React hooks like `useSession()`. See the [React quickstart](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/react).
- **SupabaseAuthAdapter** — Supabase-compatible API for easy migration. See the [migration guide](https://neon.com/docs/auth/migrate/from-supabase).

Database query methods (`client.from()`, `.select()`, etc.) work the same regardless of which adapter you use.
