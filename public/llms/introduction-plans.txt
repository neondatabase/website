Neon offers plans to support you at every stage—from your first prototype to production at scale.
Start for free, then **pay only for what you use** as your needs grow.

> The plans described on this page are Neon's new usage-based pricing plans, introduced **August 14, 2025**. If you signed up for a paid plan earlier, you may still be on a [legacy plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/legacy-plans). To switch to a new plan, see [Change your plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/manage-billing#change-your-plan). Free plan users were automatically moved to the new Free plan described below, unless you signed up through **Vercel** or **Azure Marketplace**.

   **Important**: If you signed up with Neon through **Vercel** or **Azure Marketplace**, you are still on a [Neon legacy plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/legacy-plans) — this applies to both Free and paid plans. The new usage-based pricing plans will be introduced on these platforms at a later date.

## Plan features

This section describes the features listed in the [Plan overview](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#plan-overview) table.

   **Tip** Optimize your costs: Learn how to manage your Neon costs effectively with our [cost optimization guide](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/cost-optimization), which covers strategies for compute, storage, branches, and data transfer.

### ☑ Price

**Price** is the minimum monthly fee for the plan. This is the minimum amount you'll be billed if your usage is less than $5.

> If you sign up for a paid plan part way through the month, the minimum monthly fee amount is proroated from the sign-up date.

For **Launch** and **Scale**, the minimum monthly fee is $5. Usage for compute, storage, extra branches, and other features is billed at the published rates (see the [Plan overview](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#plan-overview) table).

On the **Free** plan, there is no monthly cost. You get usage allowances for projects, branches, compute, storage, and more — for $0/month.

### ☑ Who it's for

- **Free** — Prototypes, side projects, and quick experiments. Includes 20 projects, 100 CU-hours/project, 0.5 GB storage per branch, and 5 GB of egress. Upgrade if you need more resources or features.
- **Launch** — Startups and growing teams needing more resources, features, and flexibility. Usage-based pricing starts at $5/month.
- **Scale** — Production-grade workloads and large teams. Higher limits, advanced features, full support, compliance, additional security, and SLAs. Usage-based pricing starts at $5/month.

### ☑ Projects

A project is a container for your database environment. It includes your database, branches, compute resources, and more. Similar to a Git repository that contains code, artifacts, and branches, a project contains all your database resources. Learn more about [Neon's object hierarchy](https://neon.com/docs/manage/overview).

> For most use cases, create a project for each app or customer to isolate data and manage resources.

Included per plan:

- **Free**: 20 projects
- **Launch**: 100 projects
- **Scale**: 1,000 projects (soft limit — request more if needed via [support](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/support))

### ☑ Branches

Each Neon project is created with a [root branch](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#root-branch), like the `main` branch in Git.  
Postgres objects — databases, schemas, tables, records, indexes, roles — are created on a branch.

You can create [child branches](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#child-branch) for testing, previews, or development.

Included per plan:

- **Free**: 10 branches/project
- **Launch**: 10 branches/project
- **Scale**: 25 branches/project

See [Extra branches](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#extra-branches) for overage costs and [Storage](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#storage) for how branch storage is billed.

> Projects can have multiple root branches, with limits based on your plan. See [Branch types: Root branch](https://neon.com/docs/manage/branches#root-branch) for details.

### ☑ Extra branches

On paid plans, you can create extra child branches. Extra branches beyond your plan's branch allowance (outlined [above](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#-branches)) are billed in **branch-months**, metered hourly.

1 extra branch × 1 month = 1 branch-month

Cost: **$1.50/branch-month** (~$0.002/hour).

Example: The Launch plan includes 10 branches/project. You create 2 extra branches for 5 hours each → 10 extra branch-hours × $0.002/hour = ~$0.20 total.

> Extra branches are not available on the Free plan. Delete branches or upgrade if you need more.

The maximum number of branches you can have per project:

- **Launch**: 5,000 branches/project
- **Scale**: 5,000 branches/project

If you need more, contact [Sales](https://neon.com/contact-sales).

### ☑ Compute

Compute usage depends on compute size and runtime.

- Measured in **CU-hours** (Compute Unit hours)
- 1 CU = 1 vCPU + 4 GB RAM
- RAM scales at a 4:1 ratio (4 GB RAM per 1 vCPU)
- Compute sizes up to 56 CU (plan-dependent)

| Compute Unit | vCPU | RAM    |
| ------------ | ---- | ------ |
| .25          | .25  | 1 GB   |
| .5           | .5   | 2 GB   |
| 1            | 1    | 4 GB   |
| 2            | 2    | 8 GB   |
| 3            | 3    | 12 GB  |
| ...          | ...  | ...    |
| 56           | 56   | 224 GB |

Formula:

```
compute size × hours running = CU-hours
```

Examples:

- 0.25 CU for 4 hours = 1 CU-hour
- 2 CU for 3 hours = 6 CU-hours
- 8 CU for 2 hours = 16 CU-hours

**Free**: 100 CU-hours/project/month (enough to run a 0.25 CU compute in a project for 400 hours/month).  
**Launch**: $0.14/CU-hour  
**Scale**: $0.26/CU-hour

> All computes in your project count toward usage. Each branch has a read-write compute by default; [read replicas](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#read-replica) add read-only computes.

#### Compute with autoscaling

Autoscaling changes compute size between a defined min and max. Estimate usage as:

```
average compute size × hours running = CU-hours
```

#### Compute with scale to zero

Scale to zero suspends computes after inactivity to compute usage and cost.

### ☑ Autoscaling

Adjusts compute size between defined limits based on demand.

- **Free**: Up to 2 CU (2 vCPU / 8 GB RAM)
- **Launch**: Up to 16 CU (16 vCPU / 64 GB RAM)
- **Scale**: Up to 16 CU for autoscaling; fixed sizes up to 56 CU (vCPU / 224 GB RAM)

> Autoscaling is capped at 16 CU. Scale supports fixed computes above 16 CU.

### ☑ Scale to zero

Suspends computes after inactivity.

- **Free**: 5 min inactivity — cannot disable
- **Launch**: 5 min inactivity — can disable
- **Scale**: Fully configurable — 1 minute to always on

### ☑ Storage

Storage is your data size, billed on actual usage in **GB-months**, measured hourly.

- **Launch**/**Scale plan storage cost**: $0.35/GB-month
- **[Root branches](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#root-branch)**: billed on actual data size (_logical data size_)
- **[Child branches](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#child-branch)**: billed on the minimum of the data changes since creation or the logical data size

When a child branch is created, it adds no storage initially. Once you make writes (inserts, updates, or deletes) to the child branch, the delta grows and counts toward storage.

**Child branch storage is capped at your actual data size** — you're billed for the minimum of accumulated changes or logical data size, whichever is lower.

   **Important** Manage child branches to control storage costs: Even though child branch storage is capped at your logical data size, it's still important to manage branches effectively to minimize storage costs: - Set a [time to live](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-expiration) on development and preview branches - Delete child branches when they're no longer needed - For production workloads, use a [root branch](https://neon.com/docs/manage/branches#root-branch) instead — root branches are billed on your actual data size with no delta tracking overhead.

> **Free** plan users get 0.5 GB of storage per project

### ☑ Public network transfer

Public network transfer (egress) is the total volume of data sent from your databases over the public internet during the monthly billing period.

> Public network transfer includes data sent via [logical replication](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#logical-replication) to any destination, including other Neon databases.

Allowances per plan:

- **Free**: 5 GB/month
- **Launch**: 100 GB/month, then $0.10/GB
- **Scale**: 100 GB/month, then $0.10/GB

### ☑ Monitoring

View metrics such as RAM, CPU, connections, and database size in the **Monitoring** dashboard in the Neon Console.

Retention of metrics data differs by plan:

- **Free**: 1 day
- **Launch**: 3 days
- **Scale**: 14 days

See [Monitoring dashboard](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/monitoring-page) for details.

### ☑ Metrics/logs export

Export metrics and Postgres logs to [Datadog](https://neon.com/docs/guides/datadog) or any [OTel-compatible platform](https://neon.com/docs/guides/opentelemetry).  
Available only on the **Scale** plan.

### ☑ Instant restore

Neon stores a change history to support instant restore.

- **Free**: No charge, 6-hour limit, capped at 1 GB of change history
- **Launch**: Up to 7 days, billed at $0.20/GB-month
- **Scale**: Up to 30 days, billed at $0.20/GB-month

You can change your [restore window](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#restore-window) to control how much change history you retain. See [Instant restore](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branch-restore) for details.

> The change history is a log of write operations in the form of Postgres [Write-Ahead Logs](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#write-ahead-logging-wal).

### ☑ Restore window

How far back you can restore data.

The maximum restore window per plan:

- **Free**: No charge, 6-hour limit, capped at 1 GB-month of changes
- **Launch**: Up to 7 days
- **Scale**: Up to 30 days

> The restore window defaults are 6 hours for Free plan projects and 1 day for paid plan projects.

The restore window is configurable. Shortening it can reduce [instant restore](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#instant-restore) storage costs but limits how far back you can restore. See [Configure your restore window](https://neon.com/docs/manage/projects#configure-your-restore-window).

### ☑ Private network transfer

Bi-directional data transfer to and from your databases over private networking.

Private networking is available on the **Scale** plan. It uses [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/concepts.html) to bypass the public internet.

Billed at $0.01/GB for network transferred to and from Neon. You'll only see this on your bill if you enable this feature.

### ☑ Compliance and security

Compliance certifications available on **Scale**:

- SOC 2
- SOC 3
- ISO 27001
- ISO 27701
- GDPR
- CCPA
- HIPAA ([additional charge](https://neon.com/docs/security/hipaa))

Security features:

- [Protected branches](https://neon.com/docs/guides/protected-branches) — safeguards for critical data (available on **Launch** and **Scale**)
- [IP Allow](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/ip-allow) — restricts access to trusted IPs (available on **Scale**)
- [Private Networking](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) — secure private connections via AWS PrivateLink (available on **Scale**)

### ☑ Uptime SLA

Guaranteed service availability is offered on the **Scale** plan. Contact [Sales](https://neon.com/contact-sales) for details.

### ☑ Support

Support level by plan:

- **Free**: Community support
- **Launch**: Standard support (billing issues only)
- **Scale**: Standard support, with Business or Production support plans available for an additional fee

See [Support](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/support) for details.

## Usage-based cost examples

The following examples show what your monthly bill might look like on the **Launch** and **Scale** plans at different levels of usage. Each example includes compute, storage (root and child branches), and instant restore history. Your actual costs will depend on your specific workload, usage patterns, and configuration.

> **Note:** The "billable days" shown below refer to **active compute time** — the total hours your compute is actively running in a month. Computes can scale to zero when idle, so you may accumulate these hours in shorter periods of usage throughout the month rather than running continuously.

### Launch plan

- **Example 1 (less than $5 usage)**
  - Compute: ~10 CU-hours = 1 CU × 10 hours — **$1.40**  
    _(10 CU-hours × $0.14/CU-hour)_
  - Root branch storage: 2 GB — **$0.70**  
    _(2 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Child branch storage: 1 GB — **$0.35**  
    _(1 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Instant restore history: 1 GB — **$0.20**  
    _(1 GB × $0.20/GB-month)_

    **Subtotal:** **$2.65**  
    **Minimum monthly fee:** **$5.00**  
    **Amount due:** **$5.00**

- **Example 2**
  - Compute: ~120 CU-hours = 1 CU × 120 hours (about 5 billable days) — **$16.80**  
    _(120 CU-hours × $0.14/CU-hour)_
  - Root branch storage: 20 GB — **$7.00**  
    _(20 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Child branch storage: 5 GB — **$1.75**  
    _(5 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Instant restore history: 10 GB — **$2.00**  
    _(10 GB × $0.20/GB-month)_

    **Amount due:** **$27.55**

- **Example 3**
  - Compute: ~250 CU-hours = 2 CU × 125 hours (about 5.2 billable days) — **$35.00**  
    _(250 CU-hours × $0.14/CU-hour)_
  - Root branch storage: 40 GB — **$14.00**  
    _(40 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Child branch storage: 10 GB — **$3.50**  
    _(10 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Instant restore history: 20 GB — **$4.00**  
    _(20 GB × $0.20/GB-month)_

    **Amount due:** **$56.50**

### Scale plan

- **Example 1**
  - Compute: ~1,700 CU-hours = 4 CU × 425 hours (about 17.7 billable days) — **$442.00**  
    _(1,700 CU-hours × $0.26/CU-hour)_
  - Root branch storage: 100 GB — **$35.00**  
    _(100 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Child branch storage: 25 GB — **$8.75**  
    _(25 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Instant restore history: 50 GB — **$10.00**  
    _(50 GB × $0.20/GB-month)_

    **Amount due:** **$495.75**

- **Example 2**
  - Compute: ~2,600 CU-hours = 8 CU × 325 hours (about 13.5 billable days) — **$676.00**  
    _(2,600 CU-hours × $0.26/CU-hour)_
  - Root branch storage: 150 GB — **$52.50**  
    _(150 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Child branch storage: 40 GB — **$14.00**  
    _(40 GB × $0.35/GB-month)_
  - Instant restore history: 75 GB — **$15.00**  
    _(75 GB × $0.20/GB-month)_

    **Amount due:** **$757.50**
