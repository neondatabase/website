> The document outlines the process of setting up logical replication in Neon, detailing how to configure publications and subscriptions to replicate data changes between databases.

Neon's logical replication feature, available to all Neon users, allows you to replicate data to and from your Neon Postgres database:

- Perform live migrations to Neon from external sources such as AWS RDS, Aurora, and Google Cloud SQL &#8212; or any platform that runs Postgres.
- Stream data from your Neon database to external destinations, enabling Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. External sources might include data warehouses, analytical database services, real-time stream processing systems, messaging and event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases, among others.
- Replicate data from one Neon project to another for Neon project, account, Postgres version, or region migration.



Logical replication in Neon works in the same way as logical replication on a standard Postgres installation, using a publish and subscribe model to replicate data from the source database to the destination.
