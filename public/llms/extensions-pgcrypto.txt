The `pgcrypto` extension offers a range of cryptographic functions within Postgres. These functions enable encryption, decryption, and hashing operations through standard SQL queries. This can reduce reliance on external cryptographic tools for data security tasks in a Postgres environment.



In this guide, you'll learn how to enable the `pgcrypto` extension on Neon, use its core cryptographic functions, explore practical applications for data security, and follow best practices for managing security considerations.

## Enable the `pgcrypto` extension

You can enable the extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the [Neon SQL Editor](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or from a client such as [psql](https://neon.com/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) that is connected to your Neon database.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
```

**Version availability:**

## Cryptographic functions

The `pgcrypto` extension provides a wide range of cryptographic functions that can be used directly within SQL queries. These functions can be broadly categorized into the following groups:

### General hashing functions

`pgcrypto` provides functions for generating one-way hashes, crucial for verifying data integrity and securely comparing data without revealing the original content.

- **`digest(data, type)`**:

  The `digest` function computes a binary hash of the input `data` using the algorithm specified by `type`. This function supports a wide range of algorithms, including [`md5`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5), [`sha1`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1), and the [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA2) family (`sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512`), as well as any other digest algorithm supported by the underlying OpenSSL library.

  ```sql
  SELECT digest('Sensitive Information', 'sha256');
  -- \x7daa83aa2e4618c8de40eb6642dbde3bceead971c322c66ed47676897a1b31c1 (binary output)
  ```

- **`hmac(data, key, type)`**:

  The `hmac` function calculates a keyed hash, also known as a Hash-based Message Authentication Code. It incorporates a secret `key` into the hashing process, ensuring that only parties with knowledge of the key can verify the hash. This provides both data integrity and authenticity.

  ```sql
  SELECT hmac('Data to Authenticate', 'shared_secret_key', 'sha256');
  -- \x261415730795bccaedb60061af12bf8fdb0833b4bad7735214dc78789e233257 (binary output)
  ```

### Password hashing functions

`pgcrypto` includes specialized functions designed for securely hashing passwords, essential for protecting user credentials.

- **`crypt(password text, salt text)`**:

  The `crypt` function implements a crypt(3)-style hashing algorithm, specifically tailored for password security. It takes the `password` to be hashed and a `salt` value as input.

  ```sql
  SELECT crypt('user_password', gen_salt('md5'));
  -- $1$bPYjhtip$NT.UC/6xLeoj8leDs7Neh0 (example hashed password output)
  ```

- **`gen_salt(type text [, iter_count integer ])`**:

  The `gen_salt` function generates new, random salt values for use with the `crypt()` function. The `type` parameter specifies the hashing algorithm (e.g., `bf` for Blowfish, `md5`, `xdes`, `des`). For algorithms like [Blowfish](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)>) and [Extended DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard) (`xdes`), you can specify `iter_count` to control the number of iterations, increasing the computational cost and security.

  ```sql
  SELECT gen_salt('bf'); -- Generate a Blowfish salt
  -- $2a$06$KlIoNEoix2oKbLwMimhQpu (example output)
  SELECT gen_salt('bf', 10); -- Generate Blowfish salt with 2^10 iterations
  -- $2a$10$nnHUvyZckh1VBh5zWNEFKO (example output)
  ```

### PGP encryption functions

For general-purpose encryption needs, `pgcrypto` implements the encryption part of the OpenPGP standard, providing functions for both symmetric-key and public-key encryption.

- **`pgp_sym_encrypt(data, psw [, options ])`**:

  The `pgp_sym_encrypt` function encrypts `data` using symmetric-key encryption with a provided password `psw`. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

  ```sql
  SELECT pgp_sym_encrypt('Confidential Data', 'encryption_password');
  -- \xc30d040703029c3eba2b3565a3937bd2420120ae6792f663bd35977d21a5a8e13de9a8a8e5a9212ef06f8b056dcc31e0b48096915ddac66f14ab403ea671a8b4c740a198d32bcc5b804a30ef7e9aeacd7c1246 (binary output)
  ```

- **`pgp_sym_decrypt(msg, psw [, options ])`**:

  The `pgp_sym_decrypt` function decrypts a message `msg` that was encrypted using symmetric-key encryption with the password `psw`.

  ```sql
  SELECT pgp_sym_decrypt(encrypted_message, 'encryption_password');
  -- SELECT pgp_sym_decrypt('\xc30d040703029c3eba2b3565a3937bd2420120ae6792f663bd35977d21a5a8e13de9a8a8e5a9212ef06f8b056dcc31e0b48096915ddac66f14ab403ea671a8b4c740a198d32bcc5b804a30ef7e9aeacd7c1246', 'encryption_password');
  -- Confidential Data (plaintext output)
  ```

- **`pgp_pub_encrypt(data, key [, options ])`**:

  The `pgp_pub_encrypt` function encrypts `data` using public-key encryption with a provided public `key`. Public-key encryption uses separate keys for encryption (public key) and decryption (private key).

  ```sql
  SELECT pgp_pub_encrypt('Secret Message', 'public_key_here');
  -- encrypted_message (binary output)
  ```

- **`pgp_pub_decrypt(msg, key [, psw [, options ]])`**:

  The `pgp_pub_decrypt` function decrypts a message `msg` that was encrypted using public-key encryption. It requires the private `key` corresponding to the public key used for encryption. If the private key is password-protected, the `psw` is also required.

  ```sql
  SELECT pgp_pub_decrypt(encrypted_message, 'private_key_here', 'private_key_password');
  -- Secret Message (plaintext output)
  ```

### Random data functions

`pgcrypto` provides functions for generating cryptographically secure random data, essential for various security operations.

- **`gen_random_bytes(count integer)`**:

  The `gen_random_bytes` function generates a specified number of cryptographically strong random bytes. These bytes can be used as salts, initialization vectors, or for other security-sensitive purposes.

  ```sql
  SELECT gen_random_bytes(16); -- Generate 16 random bytes
  -- \xc9259a991537e3d730db78133f208e94 (example binary output)
  ```

- **`gen_random_uuid()`**:

  The `gen_random_uuid()` function generates a version 4 universally unique identifier (UUID) based on random numbers. This is functionally equivalent to PostgreSQL's built-in [`gen_random_uuid()`](https://neon.com/postgresql/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-uuid#generating-uuid-values).

  ```sql
  SELECT gen_random_uuid();
  -- 90d18ac7-4af7-458d-8f7a-a7211b5d3eee (example output)
  ```

## Practical applications

`pgcrypto` offers a wide range of practical applications for enhancing data security within your Postgres environment:

- **Secure password storage**: Use `crypt()` and `gen_salt()` to securely store user passwords as hashes, protecting them from exposure in case of a data breach.
- **Data encryption at rest (Column-Level)**: Employ `pgp_sym_encrypt()` or `pgp_pub_encrypt()` to encrypt sensitive data columns within your tables, ensuring data confidentiality even if the database is compromised.
- **Data anonymization**: Leverage encryption functions to pseudonymize or anonymize sensitive data for non-production environments or for compliance purposes.

## Example: Secure password storage

Let's walk through a practical example of using `pgcrypto` to securely store and verify user passwords in a Postgres database.

1. Hash and salt a password using `crypt()` and `gen_salt()`

   Suppose you want to hash the password `"mypassword"`. You'll use `gen_salt()` to generate a salt and `crypt()` to hash the password with the salt. For this example, we'll use the Blowfish algorithm with 4 rounds (iterations):

   ```sql
   SELECT crypt('mypassword', gen_salt('bf', 4));
   -- $2a$04$vVVrQ777SjxyQKuFp7z6ue (example hashed password output)
   ```

   The output is the hashed password, which includes the salt and algorithm identifier. **You should store this entire hashed password string in your database, not the original password.**

2. Store the hashed password:

   Create a table to store usernames and their hashed passwords.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       username VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
       password_hash TEXT NOT NULL
   );

   INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash) VALUES
   ('testuser', '$2a$04$vVVrQ777SjxyQKuFp7z6ue'); -- Replace with the hash from the previous step
   ```

3. Verify a password during login:

   When a user attempts to log in, you'll receive the password they entered (e.g., `"mypassword"` again). To verify it, you'll use `crypt()` again, passing the entered password and the stored `password_hash` from the database.

   ```sql
   SELECT password_hash = crypt('mypassword', password_hash) AS password_match
   FROM users
   WHERE username = 'testuser';
   -- password_match
   -- --------------
   -- t
   -- (1 row)
   ```

   If the passwords match, `crypt()` will return the same stored hash (or a hash that compares as equal), and the query will return `t` (true).

4. Incorrect password attempt:

   If the user enters an incorrect password (e.g., `"wrongpassword"`), the verification will fail:

   ```sql
   SELECT password_hash = crypt('wrongpassword', password_hash) AS password_match
   FROM users
   WHERE username = 'testuser';
   -- password_match
   -- --------------
   -- f
   -- (1 row)
   ```

   In this case, the query returns `f` (false), indicating an incorrect password.

By following these steps, you can securely store and verify user passwords using `pgcrypto` in your Postgres database.

## Performance Implications

While `pgcrypto` provides robust security features, it's important to consider the performance implications of cryptographic operations:

- **Computational overhead**: Encryption, decryption, and hashing operations inherently require computational resources. The extent of the overhead depends on the chosen algorithms, data size, and frequency of operations.
- **Password hashing**: Password hashing algorithms, like those used in `crypt()`, are intentionally designed to be slow to resist brute-force attacks. This can introduce a slight delay during user authentication processes.

## Security Considerations

When using `pgcrypto`, it's crucial to adhere to security best practices:

- **Key management**: Securely manage encryption keys. Store them outside the database if possible, and implement key rotation policies. Never store keys in plaintext within the database as that would defeat the purpose of encryption.
- **Algorithm selection**: Choose appropriate cryptographic algorithms based on your security requirements. For password hashing, use strong algorithms like Blowfish with sufficient iteration counts. For data encryption, select robust and widely-vetted algorithms like AES.

## Conclusion

The `pgcrypto` extension is a powerful and versatile tool for enhancing data security in Postgres. By providing a rich set of cryptographic functions, it enables you to implement robust security measures directly within your database environment. From secure password storage to data encryption and hashing, `pgcrypto` offers a wide range of applications to protect your data.
