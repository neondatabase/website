There are several SDKs available for use with Neon. All are wrappers around the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), providing methods to programmatically manage API keys, Neon projects, branches, databases, endpoints, roles, and operations. In addition to wrapping the Neon API, the `@neondatabase/toolkit` also packages the low-latency Neon Serverless Driver, which supports SQL queries over WebSockets and HTTP.
