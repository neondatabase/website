> The Neon SDKs documentation outlines the available software development kits for integrating with Neon, detailing installation, configuration, and usage instructions to facilitate seamless interaction with Neon's database services.

Neon provides two categories of SDKs to support different use cases:

- **Client SDKs** — For application developers building apps with [Neon Auth](https://neon.com/docs/auth/overview) and the [Data API](https://neon.com/docs/data-api/overview). These SDKs handle user authentication and database queries from your application.
- **Management SDKs** — For programmatically managing Neon platform resources like projects, branches, databases, endpoints, and roles. These are wrappers around the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

## Client SDKs

Use these SDKs to build applications with Neon Auth and the Data API.

- [Neon Auth & Data API TypeScript SDKs](https://neon.com/docs/reference/javascript-sdk): Build apps with Neon Auth and Data API using authentication methods and database queries

## Management SDKs

Use these SDKs to programmatically manage your Neon infrastructure — projects, branches, databases, endpoints, roles, and operations.

- [Neon API TypeScript SDK](https://neon.com/docs/reference/typescript-sdk): Programmatically manage Neon projects, branches, databases, and other platform resources
- [Python SDK (Neon API)](https://neon.com/docs/reference/python-sdk): Programmatically manage Neon projects, branches, databases, and other platform resources
- [@neondatabase/toolkit](https://neon.com/docs/reference/neondatabase-toolkit): An SDK for AI Agents (and humans) that includes both the Neon API TypeScript SDK and the Neon Serverless Driver

## Community SDKs

   **Note**: Community SDKs are not maintained or officially supported by Neon. Some features may be out of date, so use these SDKs at your own discretion. If you have questions about these SDKs, please contact the project maintainers.
