## What is a Neon Twin?

A Neon Twin is a full or partial clone of your production or staging database, providing developers and teams with isolated, sandboxed environments that closely mirror production.



## Designed for efficiency

Creating a Neon Twin will streamline development workflows, enhance productivity, and help teams ship faster—all while being more [cost-effective](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/pricing-estimation-guide) and easier to manage than traditional development/testing environments.

## Automatically synced

The workflows in this section enable automatic synchronization between your production database and your Neon Twin.

## Instant Branches

With a Neon Twin created, [branches](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branching) can be quickly spun up or torn down, enabling developers to build new features or debug issues—all within their own isolated environments with a dedicated compute resource.

Branches can be created and managed through the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/) or programmatically via the [API](https://neon.com/docs/reference/api-reference).
