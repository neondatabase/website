# Neon for AI Agent Platforms

> The document "Neon for AI Agent Platforms" outlines how Neon's serverless Postgres architecture supports AI agent platforms by providing instant provisioning, automatic scaling, and integrated services for building full-stack backends, all managed through an API-first approach.

## The Neon Stack For Agents

The Neon architecture aligns with how agents work:

**Serverless Postgres at the core.**
Neon's backend is powered by a serverless Postgres engine built on separated compute and storage. It provisions instantly, scales automatically, and idles to zero when not in use - perfect for the bursty, on-demand workloads that agents create.

**With integrated services for full-stack backends.**
Around that core, Neon includes Auth and a PostgREST-compatible Data API, so agents and developers can assemble complete, production-ready backends without stitching multiple services together.

**All API-first and programmable.**
Every capability - provisioning, quotas, branching, and fleet management - is exposed through the Neon API, giving developers and agents precise control over their environments and usage at scale.

**And version-aware by design.**
Neon's copy-on-write storage makes time travel effortless. Branching, snapshots, and point-in-time recovery enable undo, checkpoints, and safe experimentation across millions of databases.

## Serverless Postgres, API-first

At the core of Neon is a serverless Postgres architecture that [separates compute from storage](https://neon.com/blog/architecture-decisions-in-neon). Each database runs on ephemeral computes while the data itself lives on durable, high-performance storage.

**This architecture makes it possible for agents to provision databases instantly on demand, operate them at massive scale, and still keep costs under control.** Tens of thousands of projects can spin up and idle as users create apps, all programmatically, without intervention from you.



## Instant Autoscaling and Scale-to-Zero

Traditional database management falls apart when every agent action can trigger new infrastructure. Neon serverless model handles this complexity automatically:

- [Compute scales up and down in real time based on workload](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/autoscaling)
- [Scale-to-zero ensures that idle databases cost you nothing](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/scale-to-zero) while remaining instantly accessible

This combination gives agent builders a sustainable model for large fleets: **you can create thousands of databases without worrying about resource exhaustion or runaway bills.**



## Auth That Speaks Postgres

Every app needs authentication, and agents shouldn't have to reinvent it. **[Neon Auth](https://neon.com/docs/neon-auth/overview) lets you build secure, multi-tenant systems [without extra glue code](https://neon.com/blog/databutton-neon-integration)**.

It issues JWTs that your agent or front-end can use directly in database queries or through the [Neon Data API](https://neon.com/docs/data-api/get-started). Each token maps to a Postgres role, enforcing granular access at the data level. And because Neon Auth supports standard JWKS configuration, you can also plug in external providers.



## A PostgREST-Compatible Data API, Built In

Giving your agents direct access to the database is simple with the [Neon Data API](https://neon.com/docs/data-api/get-started). It exposes each database (and every branch) as a REST endpoint you can query over HTTPS. Fully PostgREST-compatible.

Under the hood, Neon's Data API is a [Rust-based re-implementation of PostgREST that runs natively in our proxy fleet](https://neon.com/blog/a-postgrest-compatible-data-api-now-on-neon). It's lean, multi-tenant, and designed to scale across thousands of databases efficiently. Every Neon branch has its own API endpoint, perfect for preview environments, checkpoints, or dev branches.

## Building Checkpoints with Snapshots and Branching

**Vibe coders experiment constantly, going back and forward between versions - and sometimes breaking things. Neon's [branching](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branching) and [snapshots API](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-database-versioning) turn this into a feature, not a risk.**

Branching, built on our copy-on-write storage, enables [instant point-in-time recovery](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branch-restore) for any database. Developers and agents can migrate schemas or revert mistakes without complex restores.

The Snapshots API builds on this foundation to create [agent-friendly, restorable checkpoints](https://neon.com/blog/checkpoints-for-agents-with-neon-snapshots). Agents can capture a moment-in-time version of the database (schema and data) and later roll back or compare states.

## Quotas, Fleet Control, and Dedicated Pricing

**We've been backing agent platforms since the start, and our API has evolved to support the needs of large fleets operated by small engineering teams.** [The Neon API lets you manage not only infra but also setting quotas, tracking compute/storage usage per project, billing limits, and much more](https://neon.com/blog/provision-postgres-neon-api).

Combined with usage-based pricing and agent-specific plans, it gives platform builders fine-grained control over cost, scale, and growth.
