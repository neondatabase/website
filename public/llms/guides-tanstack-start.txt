# Connect a TanStack Start application to Neon

> The document details the process for connecting a TanStack Start application to a Neon database, including configuration steps and code examples specific to establishing a successful connection within Neon's environment.

## Source

- [Connect a TanStack Start application to Neon HTML](https://neon.com/docs/guides/tanstack-start): The original HTML version of this documentation

TanStack Start is an open-source, fully type-safe web framework for building feature rich React and Solid based applications using the TanStack ecosystem.

To create a Neon project and access it from a Start application:

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a Start project and add dependencies

1. Create a Start project if you do not have one. For instructions see the [quick start guides](https://tanstack.com/start/latest), in the [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/) documentation.

2. Add project dependencies using one of the following commands:

   Tab: node-postgres

   ```shell
   npm install pg
   ```

Tab: postgres.js

   ```shell
   npm install postgres
   ```

Tab: Neon serverless driver

   ```shell
   npm install @neondatabase/serverless
   ```

## Store your Neon credentials

Add a `.env` file to your project directory and add your Neon connection string to it. You can find your Neon database connection string by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard** to open the **Connect to your database** modal. For more information, see [Connect from any application](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

```shell
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>.neon.tech:<port>/<dbname>?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require"
```

If you haven't created a database yet, run the following command to generate a [Neon Instagres DB](https://neon.new/). It will spin up a database instance that you can use for 72 hours, or claim to keep forever.

Tab: npm

```bash
  npm get-db
```

Tab: yarn

```bash
  yarn dlx get-db
```

Tab: pnpm

```bash
  pnpm get-db
```

Tab: bun

```bash
  bunx get-db
```

Tab: deno

```bash
  deno run -A get-db
```

## Configure the Postgres client

There are multiple ways to make server side requests with TanStack Start. See below for the different implementations.

### Server Functions

In your server functions, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:

Tab: node-postgres

```

```typescript filename="src/data/get-neon-data.ts"
import postgres from 'postgres';
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const getData = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
   const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });
  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  return response[0].version;
});
```

Then consume the data in your start application, like you would normally, with any other data fetching operation.

```typescript filename="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { getData } from "../data/get-neon-data.ts";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  loader: async () => {
    return getData();
  },

  component: RouteComponent,
});

export default function RouteComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData();

  return <>{data}</>;
}
```

### Static Server Functions

In your static server functions, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:

Tab: node-postgres

```

```typescript filename="src/data/get-neon-data.ts"
import postgres from 'postgres';
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { staticFunctionMiddleware } from "@tanstack/start-static-server-functions";

export const getData = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
.middleware([staticFunctionMiddleware])
.handler(async () => {
  const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });
  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  return response[0].version;
});
```

Then like before you can consume the data in your components.

_Be aware Static Server Functions are executed at build time, and cached as a static asset for pre-rendering or static generation_.

```typescript filename="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { getData } from "../data/get-neon-data.ts";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  loader: async () => {
    return getData();
  },

  component: RouteComponent,
});

export default function RouteComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData();

  return <>{data}</>;
}
```

## Run the app

When you run `npm run dev` you can expect to see the following on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/):

```shell
PostgreSQL 16.0 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, 64-bit
```

### Where to upload and serve files?

Neon does not provide a built-in file storage service. For managing binary file data (blobs), we recommend a pattern that leverages dedicated, specialized storage services. Follow our guide on [File Storage](https://neon.com/docs/guides/file-storage) to learn more about how to store files in external object storage and file management services and track metadata in Neon.
