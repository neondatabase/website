## Overview

Neon is a fully managed serverless Postgres.

If you are already familiar with Postgres, you can jump to [Query with psql](https://neon.com/docs/tutorials#query-with-psql) to learn how to connect to your project with 'psql'.
Then, look at the examples of how to do branching and Point-in-Time queries (coming soon).

If you are new to Postgres, look at our [web query editor](https://neon.com/docs/tutorials#query-via-ui) for a primer.

For instructions on how to use Neon with your application stack, see [Integrations](https://neon.com/docs/integrations).
