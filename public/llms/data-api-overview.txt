# Neon Data API

> The Neon Data API documentation outlines the API's capabilities for interacting with Neon databases, detailing its endpoints, authentication methods, and usage guidelines to facilitate database management and data retrieval.

**Note** Beta: The **Neon Data API** is in Beta. Share your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or via the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback).

The Neon Data API provides a secure, stateless HTTP interface to your database. It allows you to access and manage your data directly from web browsers, serverless functions, and edge runtimes using standard HTTP methods. Key benefits include:

- **Browser & edge compatibility**

  Standard Postgres drivers do not work in web browsers and struggle in edge runtimes. The Data API allows you to query your database from Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, or directly from a browser-based frontend using standard HTTP requests.

- **Connectionless scalability**

  Eliminate connection pool exhaustion. Because the API uses short-lived HTTP requests instead of persistent TCP connections, it effortlessly handles thousands of concurrent users and serverless auto-scaling.

- **Secure by default**

  The API is designed to expose your database safely. It integrates with Neon Auth and respects PostgreSQL [Row-Level Security (RLS)](https://neon.com/docs/guides/row-level-security) policies, ensuring users only access the data they are explicitly permitted to see.

- **CI/CD integration**

  Test your Data API integrations in isolated branch environments using the [Neon Create Branch GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/neon-create-branch-github-action), which can retrieve branch-specific Data API URLs for your workflows.

## PostgREST compatibility

The Neon Data API is fully compatible with [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/). This compatibility allows you to query your database using any standard HTTP client (such as Postman or `cURL`) or integrate easily using client libraries, including [`@neondatabase/neon-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neondatabase/neon-js) and [`@neondatabase/postgrest-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neondatabase/postgrest-js).
