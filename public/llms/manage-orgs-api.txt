# Manage organizations using the Neon API

> The document details how to manage organizations using the Neon API, including creating, updating, and deleting organizations, and managing organization members and roles within the Neon platform.

## Source

- [Manage organizations using the Neon API HTML](https://neon.com/docs/manage/orgs-api): The original HTML version of this documentation

Learn how to manage Neon Organizations using the Neon API, including managing organization API keys, working with organization members, and handling member invitations.

## Personal vs organization API keys

You can authorize your API requests using either of these methods:

- **Organization API key**: Automatically scopes all requests to your organization
- **Personal API key**: Requires including an `org_id` parameter to specify which organization you're working with

The key difference is in how you structure your API requests. Here's an example of listing projects using both methods:

Using an organization API key:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $ORG_API_KEY'
```

Using a personal API key:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects?org_id=org-example-12345678' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $PERSONAL_API_KEY'
```

Both examples retrieve a list of projects, but notice how the personal API key request includes `org_id=org-example-12345678` to specify which organization's projects to list. With an organization API key, this parameter isn't needed because the key itself is already tied to a specific organization.

### Matrix of operations and key types

Some operations require a personal API key from an organization admin and cannot be performed using organization API keys. These operations are marked with ❌ in the matrix below.

## Finding your org_id

To find your organization's `org_id`, navigate to your Organization's **Settings** page, where you'll find it under the **General information** section. Copy and use this ID in your API requests.



## Create API keys

There are two types of organization API keys:

- **Organization API keys** — Provide admin-level access to all organization resources, including projects, members, and settings. Only organization admins can create these keys.
- **Project-scoped organization API keys** — Provide limited, member-level access to specific projects within the organization. Any organization member can create a key for any organization-owned project.

The key token is only displayed once at creation time. Copy it immediately and store it securely. If lost, you'll need to revoke the key and create a new one. For detailed instructions, see [Manage API Keys](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-organization-api-key).

## List API keys

Lists all API keys for your organization. The response does not include the actual key tokens, as these are only provided when creating a new key.

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/organizations/{org_id}/api_keys' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $PERSONAL_API_KEY' | jq
