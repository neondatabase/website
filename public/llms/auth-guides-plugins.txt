**Note** Beta: The **Neon Auth with Better Auth** is in Beta. Share your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or via the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback).

Neon Auth is built on [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/), which supports a variety of plugins to extend authentication functionality.

   **Info** Plugins are managed by Neon Auth: Neon Auth is a **managed** Better Auth service. You **don't install or configure Better Auth plugins directly** - instead, Neon Auth exposes a supported subset of plugins through the Neon SDK. More granular controls like enabling/disabling specific plugins and customizing plugin behavior are on the roadmap.

The following Better Auth plugins are currently supported in Neon Auth:
