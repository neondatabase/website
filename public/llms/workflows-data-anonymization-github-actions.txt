# Data anonymization with GitHub Actions

> The document outlines a workflow for implementing data anonymization in Neon databases using GitHub Actions, detailing steps to automate the anonymization process for enhanced data privacy during development and testing.

This page shows how to automate data anonymization with GitHub Actions. For conceptual overview and usage instructions, see [Data Anonymization](https://neon.com/docs/workflows/data-anonymization).

Automate anonymized branch creation using the [Neon Create Branch Action](https://github.com/neondatabase/create-branch-action). The `masking_rules` input lets you define masking rules directly in your workflow, creating an anonymized branch in a single step.

## Requirements

Before setting up the workflow:

- A **Neon project** with a populated parent branch
- The following GitHub repository secrets:
  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID`
  - `NEON_API_KEY`

   **Tip**: The Neon GitHub integration configures these secrets automatically. See [Neon GitHub integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-github-integration).

## Set up the workflow

Create a file at `.github/workflows/create-anon-branch.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Create Anonymized Branch for PR

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened]

jobs:
  create-anon-branch:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create anonymized branch
        uses: neondatabase/create-branch-action@v6
        id: create-branch
        with:
          project_id: ${{ secrets.NEON_PROJECT_ID }}
          branch_name: anon-pr-${{ github.event.number }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
          masking_rules: |
            [
              {
                "database_name": "neondb",
                "schema_name": "public",
                "table_name": "users",
                "column_name": "email",
                "masking_function": "anon.dummy_free_email()"
              },
              {
                "database_name": "neondb",
                "schema_name": "public",
                "table_name": "users",
                "column_name": "first_name",
                "masking_function": "anon.fake_first_name()"
              },
              {
                "database_name": "neondb",
                "schema_name": "public",
                "table_name": "users",
                "column_name": "last_name",
                "masking_function": "anon.fake_last_name()"
              }
            ]

      - name: Output branch details
        run: |
          echo "Branch ID: ${{ steps.create-branch.outputs.branch_id }}"
          echo "Database URL: ${{ steps.create-branch.outputs.db_url }}"
```

The `masking_rules` input accepts a JSON array where each rule specifies:

| Field              | Description                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `database_name`    | Target database (e.g., `neondb`)        |
| `schema_name`      | Target schema (typically `public`)      |
| `table_name`       | Table containing sensitive data         |
| `column_name`      | Column to mask                          |
| `masking_function` | PostgreSQL Anonymizer function to apply |

For available masking functions, see [PostgreSQL Anonymizer documentation](https://postgresql-anonymizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/masking_functions/) or the [Manage masking rules](https://neon.com/docs/workflows/data-anonymization#manage-masking-rules) section of the main guide.

   **Note**: The `masking_rules` input creates a new anonymized branch. Masking rules cannot be applied to existing branches.

## Testing the workflow

1. Customize and push the workflow file to your repository
2. Open a new pull request
3. Check the **Actions** tab to monitor workflow execution
4. Verify the anonymized branch in the Neon Console or connect to it to confirm data is masked

## Clean up branches

Clean up anonymized branches when no longer needed. Automate this with the [delete-branch-action](https://github.com/neondatabase/delete-branch-action) when PRs close:

```yaml
name: Delete Branch on PR Close

on:
  pull_request:
    types: closed

jobs:
  delete-branch:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Delete anonymized branch
        uses: neondatabase/delete-branch-action@v3
        with:
          project_id: ${{ secrets.NEON_PROJECT_ID }}
          branch: anon-pr-${{ github.event.number }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
```
