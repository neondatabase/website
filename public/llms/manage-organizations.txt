# Organizations

> The "Organizations" documentation outlines how Neon users can manage and configure organizational settings, including creating, modifying, and deleting organizations within the Neon platform.

## Source

- [Organizations HTML](https://neon.com/docs/manage/organizations): The original HTML version of this documentation

In Neon, all projects live within organizations. When you sign up, you automatically get a free organization for your first project. Organizations provide a central place to manage your projects, collaborate with team members, and — for paid plans — handle your billing.

## About Neon Organizations

In the Neon Console, the Organizations page gives you a centralized view of all your projects. From there, you can create new projects, manage existing ones, and oversee your members, billing information, and access to preview features through the [Early Access Program](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/roadmap#organization-early-access).



## User roles and permissions

Organizations have two main member roles:

- **Admin** — Full control over the organization and all its projects.
- **Member** — Access to all organization projects, but cannot modify org settings or delete projects.

For a full breakdown of what each role can do, see the [User Permissions](https://neon.com/docs/manage/user-permissions) page.

## Creating a new organization

You can create additional organizations at any time. [See how to create an organization.](https://neon.com/docs/manage/orgs-manage#create-an-organization)

## Limitations

As we continue to refine our organization features, here are some temporary limitations you should be aware of:

- **Branch management** — All users are currently able to manage [protected branches](https://neon.com/docs/guides/protected-branches), regardless of their role or permission level. Granular permissions for this feature are not yet implemented.
- **Permissions and roles** — The current permissions system may not meet all needs for granular control. Users are encouraged to share their feedback and requirements for more detailed permissions settings.

## Feedback

If you've got feature requests or feedback about what you'd like to see from Organizations in Neon, let us know via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or our [feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042) on Discord.
