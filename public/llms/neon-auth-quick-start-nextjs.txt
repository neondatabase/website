# Neon Auth for Next.js

> The document "Neon Auth for Next.js" provides a quick-start guide for integrating Neon authentication into Next.js applications, detailing setup instructions and code examples specific to Neon's authentication services.

## Source

- [Neon Auth for Next.js HTML](https://neon.com/docs/neon-auth/quick-start/nextjs): The original HTML version of this documentation

Other frameworks:
- [Neon Auth for React](https://neon.com/docs/neon-auth/quick-start/react)
- [Neon Auth for JavaScript](https://neon.com/docs/neon-auth/quick-start/javascript)
  Sample project:
- [Next.js Demo App](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon-auth-demo-app)

**Note** Beta: **Neon Auth** is in beta and ready to use. We're actively improving it based on feedback from developers like you. Share your experience in our [Discord](https://t.co/kORvEuCUpJ) or via the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback).

Neon Auth lets you add authentication to your app in seconds — user data is synced directly to your Neon Postgres database, so you can query and join it just like any other table.

## Add Neon Auth to a project

Go to [pg.new](https://pg.new) to create a new Neon project.

Once your project is ready, open your project's **Auth** page and click **Enable Neon Auth** to get started.



## Get your Neon Auth keys

On the **Configuration** tab, select your framework to get the **Environment variables** you need to integrate Neon Auth and connect to your database.

You can use these keys right away to get started, or [skip ahead](https://neon.com/docs/neon-auth/quick-start/nextjs#create-users-in-the-console-optional) to try out **user creation** in the Neon Console.

```bash
# Neon Auth environment variables for Next.js

NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_NEON_AUTH_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=YOUR_NEON_AUTH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=YOUR_NEON_AUTH_SECRET_KEY

# Your Neon connection string

DATABASE_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING

```

 **Note** Are you a Vercel user?: If you're using the [Vercel-Managed Integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/neon), the integration automatically sets these environment variables for you in Vercel when you connect a Vercel project to a Neon database. [Learn more](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration#environment-variables-set-by-the-integration).

## Set up your app

**Clone our template** for the fastest way to see Neon Auth in action.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon-auth-nextjs-template.git
```

Or **add Neon Auth** to an existing project.

#### Run the setup wizard

```bash
npx @stackframe/init-stack@latest
```

This sets up auth routes, layout wrappers, and handlers automatically for Next.js (App Router).

#### Use your environment variables

Paste the Neon Auth environment variables from [Step 2](https://neon.com/docs/neon-auth/quick-start/nextjs#get-your-neon-auth-keys) into your `.env.local` file.

Then `npm run dev` to start your dev server.

#### Test your integration

Go to [http://localhost:3000/handler/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/handler/sign-up) in your browser. Create a user or two, and you can them [show up immediately](https://neon.com/docs/neon-auth/quick-start/nextjs#see-your-users-in-the-database) in your database.

## Create users in the Console (optional)

You can create test users directly from the Neon Console — no app integration required. This is useful for development or testing.



Now you can [see your users in the database](https://neon.com/docs/neon-auth/quick-start/nextjs#see-your-users-in-the-database).

## See your users in the database

As users sign up or log in — through your app or by creating test users in the Console — their profiles are synced to your Neon database in the `neon_auth.users_sync` table.

Query your users table in the SQL Editor to see your new user:

```sql
SELECT * FROM neon_auth.users_sync;
```

| id | name | email | created_at | updated_at | deleted_at | raw_json |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| 51e491df... | Sam Patel | sam@startup.dev | 2025-02-12 19:43... | 2025-02-12 19:46... | null | `{"id": "51e491df...", ...}` |
