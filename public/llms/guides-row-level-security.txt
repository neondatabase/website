# Row-Level Security with Neon

> The "Row-Level Security with Neon" documentation explains how to implement row-level security policies in Neon databases, enabling fine-grained access control by restricting data visibility at the row level based on user roles and conditions.

Row-Level Security (RLS) is a Postgres feature that controls access to individual rows in a table based on the current user. Here's a simple example that limits the `notes` a user can see by matching rows where their `user_id` matches the session's `auth.user_id()`:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on a table
ALTER TABLE notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that only allows users to access their own notes
CREATE POLICY "users_can_only_access_own_notes" ON notes
  FOR ALL USING (auth.user_id() = user_id);
```

When using the Data API for client-side querying, RLS policies are required to secure your data.

## Data API with RLS

The **Data API** turns your database tables on a given branch into a REST API, and it requires RLS policies on all tables to ensure your data is secure.

### How it works

- The Data API handles JWT validation and provides the `auth.user_id()` function.
- Your RLS policies use `auth.user_id()` to control access.
- All tables accessed via the Data API must have RLS enabled.

## RLS with Drizzle ORM

Drizzle makes it simple to write RLS policies that work with the Data API. We highly recommend using its `crudPolicy` helper to simplify common RLS patterns.
