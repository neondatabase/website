Neon Auth is in active development. This page shows what's currently supported and what we're working on next.

## Frameworks

### Supported

| Framework               | Status       | Quick start                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Next.js                 | ✅ Supported | [Get started](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/nextjs)                  |
| React + React Router    | ✅ Supported | [Get started](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/react-router-components) |
| React + TanStack Router | ✅ Supported | [Get started](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/tanstack-router)         |
| Vite + React            | ✅ Supported | [Get started](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/react)                   |

### On the roadmap

| Framework                     | Status          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| Standalone frontend + backend | 🔜 Coming soon  |
| Other frameworks              | Based on demand |

   **Note** Standalone architectures: Architectures where frontend and backend are separate deployments (e.g., Create-React-App with a separate Node/Express backend) are not yet supported. Neon Auth uses HTTP-only cookies for secure session management, and these cookies cannot be securely shared between frontend and backend applications on different domains. We're actively working on this.

## Better Auth plugins

Neon Auth is built on [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/). Not all Better Auth plugins are currently supported.
