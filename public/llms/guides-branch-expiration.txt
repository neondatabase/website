## Overview

Branch expiration allows you to set automatic deletion timestamps on branches. When a branch reaches its expiration time, it is automatically deleted.

   **Tip** Quick guide: **Console:** When creating a branch, **Automatically delete branch after** is checked by default with 1 day selected. You can choose 1 hour, 1 day, or 7 days, or uncheck to disable. When updating an existing branch, you can select a custom date and time. **CLI:** Use `--expires-at` with [RFC 3339 format](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-expiration#timestamp-format-requirements) (e.g., `2025-07-15T18:02:16Z`). Note: Expiration must be explicitly set; there is no default. **API:** Use `expires_at` with [RFC 3339 format](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-expiration#timestamp-format-requirements) (e.g., `2025-07-15T18:02:16Z`). Note: Expiration must be explicitly set; there is no default.

## Why use branch expiration?

Branch expiration is ideal for temporary branches that have predictable lifespans:

- **CI/CD environments** - Test branches that should clean up after pipeline completion
- **Feature development** - Time-boxed feature branches with known deadlines
- **Automated testing** - Ephemeral test environments created by scripts
- **AI workflows** - Temporary environments managed without human intervention

Without automatic expiration, these branches accumulate over time, increasing storage costs and project clutter.

   **Tip**: Example expiration durations: CI/CD pipelines (2-4 hours), demos (24-48 hours), feature development (1-7 days), long-term testing (30 days).

## How it works

Branch expiration uses a time-to-live (TTL) model. When you set an expiration on a branch, you're defining how long the branch should exist before automatic deletion.

When you set an expiration timestamp on a branch:

1. The system stores both:
   - **Expiration timestamp** (`expires_at`) - The scheduled date and time when the branch will be deleted
   - **TTL interval** (`ttl_interval_seconds`) - The duration between creation/update and expiration (e.g., 24 hours = 86400 seconds), a read-only value

2. A background process monitors branches and deletes them after their expiration time is reached

3. If you reset a branch from its parent, the TTL countdown restarts using the original interval

   **Important**: Branch deletion is permanent and cannot be recovered. All associated data and compute endpoints are also deleted. Verify expiration times carefully before setting them.

## Setting branch expiration

You can set, update, or remove expiration timestamps through three interfaces:

- **Console** - When creating a branch, **Automatically delete branch after** is checked by default with 1 day selected. You can choose 1 hour, 1 day, or 7 days, or uncheck to disable. When updating an existing branch, you can select a custom date and time.
- **CLI** - Use the `--expires-at` flag when creating or updating a branch with [RFC 3339](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-expiration#timestamp-format-requirements) format. Note: Expiration must be explicitly set; there is no default.
- **API** - Use the `expires_at` parameter with [RFC 3339](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-expiration#timestamp-format-requirements) format. Note: Expiration must be explicitly set; there is no default.

See the [Examples](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-expiration#examples) section below for detailed usage of each method.

## Timestamp format requirements

The `expires_at` parameter must use [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) format with second-level precision:

**Format patterns:**

```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ         (UTC)
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM    (Positive UTC offset)
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-HH:MM    (Negative UTC offset)
```

**Valid examples:**

- `2025-07-15T18:02:16Z` (UTC)
- `2025-07-15T18:02:16-05:00` (Eastern Standard Time)
- `2025-07-15T18:02:16+09:00` (Japan Standard Time)

**Requirements:**

- Time zone is required: use either `Z` for UTC or a numeric offset like `+05:00`
- Fractional seconds are optional but only second precision is stored
- Timestamp must be in the future
- Maximum expiration is 30 days from the current time

   **Note**: Common errors include missing timezone (`2025-07-15T18:02:16`), past timestamps, or combining `Z` with offset (`2025-07-15T18:02:16Z-05:00`).

## Restrictions

To maintain system integrity, expiration timestamps cannot be added to:

- **Protected branches** - Cannot expire protected branches or protect branches with expiration
- **Default branches** - Cannot expire default branches or set expiring branches as default
- **Parent branches** - Cannot expire branches that have children or create children from expiring branches

Branch expiration is not supported with these Neon features:

- **Data API**
- **Neon Auth**

   **Note**: When a branch expires and is deleted, all associated compute endpoints are also deleted. Ensure any critical workloads are migrated before expiration.

## Examples

### Creating a branch with expiration

Tab: Console

1. Navigate to the **Branches** page in the Console
2. Click **New branch**
3. Enter branch name and select parent branch
4. By default, **Automatically delete branch after** is checked with 1 day selected. You can choose 1 hour, 1 day, or 7 days, or uncheck to disable.



5. Click **Create**

### Retrieving branch information

Check expiration status of your branches:

Tab: Console

1. Navigate to the **Branches** page in the Console
2. Click on the desired branch to open the **Branch Overview**
3. See information similar to the following if branch expiration is set:



Tab: CLI

```bash
neon branches info <branch_id> --project-id <project_id>
```

Tab: API

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id} \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

## API reference

### Create project branch

[`POST /projects/{project_id}/branches`](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch)

- **`expires_at`** (optional) - Timestamp for automatic deletion in [RFC 3339](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-expiration#timestamp-format-requirements) format

### Update project branch

[`PATCH /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}`](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectbranch)

- **`expires_at`** (optional, nullable) - Update or remove expiration
  - Timestamp value: Sets/updates expiration
  - `null`: Removes expiration
  - Omitted: No change

### Response fields

Branches with expiration include two key fields:

- **`expires_at`** - The scheduled deletion timestamp ([RFC 3339](https://neon.com/docs/guides/branch-expiration#timestamp-format-requirements) format)
- **`ttl_interval_seconds`** - The original TTL duration in seconds (read-only)

#### How these fields work together

When you create a branch with a TTL of 24 hours, `ttl_interval_seconds` is set to 86400 (seconds). The `expires_at` value is calculated as creation time plus 24 hours.

If you reset the branch from its parent, the `expires_at` value is recalculated using the preserved `ttl_interval_seconds` value, starting from the reset time. The interval itself remains unchanged.

**Example response:**

```json {4,5}
{
  "branch": {
    "id": "br-feature-67890",
    "expires_at": "2026-01-29T18:02:16Z",
    "ttl_interval_seconds": 86400,
    "created_at": "2026-01-28T18:02:16Z"
  }
}
```

In this example, the branch will be deleted 24 hours after creation.
