# Accounts

> The "Accounts" documentation for Neon details the procedures for managing user accounts, including account creation, access control, and permissions within the Neon platform.

## Source

- [Accounts HTML](https://neon.com/docs/manage/accounts): The original HTML version of this documentation

Your **Neon account** is your personal identity for logging in, managing your profile, and authenticating actions across all organizations you belong to.

## Account settings

You can access your Neon account settings from anywhere in the Console. Just click your profile avatar and select **Account settings** from the menu.



Here's what you can do from **Account settings**.

## Update personal information

Change your name or email address.



**If you signed up with email**

By default, your email will be used as your first name. You may want to add your first and last name here to complete your profile. Your email is your login and where we'll send all account communications.

**If you signed up with Google, GitHub, or another provider**

Your name and email come from your social account. Feel free to change your name to whatever works for you. If you change your email, we'll unlink your social account and switch you to email sign-in. After that, you'll use your new email and password to log in.

**Changing your email**

If you change your email (whether you started with email or social login), you'll get a verification email to confirm. Once confirmed, your new address becomes your login. If you're using a social login and change your email, we'll unlink your social account and switch you to email sign-in.

### Need to switch your login method?

**If you signed up with Google or GitHub**, you can switch to email login by changing your email and setting a password.

**If you signed up with email,** it's not currently possible to switch to a social login. [Contact Support](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/support) and we'll help you out.

## Change password

No surprises here — just enter your current password, then your new one (twice). We'll enforce our current password rules for your security.

## Create personal API keys

Personal API keys let you securely interact with the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), including through command-line tools, scripts, or third-party integrations that use the API.. Your personal API key works for any organization you belong to — so you can manage projects, automate tasks, or use integrations across all your orgs with a single key. The actions you can perform with your key depend on your role in each org (admin, member, or collaborator). You can create, view, and revoke your personal API keys here in your account settings.

## Delete account

Delete your Neon account after leaving or deleting all orgs and projects.

**Leaving an org**

If you're the only admin, promote another member to admin first. You can then leave the org.

**Deleting an org**

Remove all members (so you're the only one left), delete all projects, and you can then delete the org.

Once you have no orgs left, you can then click **Delete**.

### What happens after you delete your account

- You'll receive a confirmation email.
- If you change your mind, you can reactivate your account by logging in again within 30 days. Your personal info will be restored, though not your API keys.
- After 30 days, your account and all related data will be permanently deleted.

## Need to recover access to an account?

See [Account Recovery](https://neon.com/docs/manage/account-recovery) for step-by-step instructions if you need to regain access to a Neon account.
