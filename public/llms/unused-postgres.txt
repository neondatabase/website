## Overview

A Neon compute runs regular Postgres, which means that you run any Postgres app with Neon.

You can also connect to Neon using standard Postgres client utilities such as `psql` and `pg_dump`, standard client libraries, and drivers.

For `psql` connection instructions, see [Query with psql](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/query-with-psql-editor).

Neon supports connection pooling. For information about enabling connection pooling in your Neon project, see [Connection pooling](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/connection-pooling).
