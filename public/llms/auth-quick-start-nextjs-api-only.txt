**Note** Beta: The **Neon Auth with Better Auth** is in Beta. Share your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or via the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback).

This guide shows you how to integrate Neon Auth into a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router) project using SDK methods directly. To use our pre-built UI components instead, see the [UI components guide](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/nextjs).



## Available SDK methods

Both `authClient` and `authServer` expose similar API methods. If you would like to use auth APIs in client components, you can use `authClient`.

- [authClient.signUp.email()](https://neon.com/docs/reference/javascript-sdk#auth-signup) - Create a new user account
- [authClient.signIn.email()](https://neon.com/docs/reference/javascript-sdk#auth-signinwithpassword) - Sign in with email and password
- [authClient.signOut()](https://neon.com/docs/reference/javascript-sdk#auth-signout) - Sign out the current user
- [authClient.getSession()](https://neon.com/docs/reference/javascript-sdk#auth-getsession) - Get the current session
- `authServer.updateUser()` - To update user details
