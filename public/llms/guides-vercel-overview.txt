## Choose your integration path

   **Important** Do you need custom CI/CD control?: **If you want to build preview branching into your own CI/CD pipelines (e.g., via GitHub Actions)**, use a **[manual connection](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-manual)** instead of the automated integrations below.

For automated integrations, follow this simple flow:

## Do you have an existing Neon account?

**Do you already have a Neon account or project you want to keep using?**

- **✅ Yes** → Use **[Neon-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-managed-vercel-integration)**
- **❌ No** → Continue below

## Choose your billing preference

**Where would you like to manage billing for Neon?**

- **Through my Vercel account** → Use **[Vercel-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration)**
- **Directly with Neon** → Use **[Neon-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-managed-vercel-integration)**
