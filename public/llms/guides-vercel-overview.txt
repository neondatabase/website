Neon supports different options for integrating Neon and Vercel, including a native integration that you can install from the Vercel Marketplace, a "previews integration" that creates a database branch with every pull request, and a manual setup option. If you're currently a Vercel Postgres user, you'll also find information below about the upcoming transition from Vercel Postgres to Neon.

## Option 1: Vercel Native Integration

This integration is intended for Vercel users who want to add Neon Postgres to their Vercel project as a [first-party native integration](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/product-integration). The integration creates a Neon Postgres account for you if you do not have one. You get access to Neon features and plans. **Billing is managed through Vercel**. The integration also supports automatic creation of a database branch with each Vercel preview deployment so that you can preview application and database changes together without impacting your production database.

[Preview deployments](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-native-integration-previews) - Create a database branch for every preview deployment with the Neon Postgres Native Integration

## Option 2: Add the Postgres Previews Integration

This integration is intended for users who are registered with Neon directly. The **Postgres Previews Integration** is a [connectable account integration](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/add-a-connectable-account#manage-connectable-accounts) that connects your Vercel project to a Neon database and creates a database branch with each Vercel preview deployment.

## Option 3: Connect your Vercel project to Neon manually (no integration)

This setup simply involves setting environment variables in Vercel to connect your Vercel Project to your Neon database.

## Transitioning from Vercel Postgres?
