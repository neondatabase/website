# Database branching workflow primer

> This guide introduces Neon's database branching feature and how to integrate it into your development workflow, covering branch creation methods using the Neon CLI or GitHub Actions, and implementation strategies for development, preview, and testing environments.

## Overview

With Neon, you can work with your data just like you work with your code. The key is Neon's database branching feature, which lets you instantly create branches of your data that you can include in your workflow — as many branches as you need.

Neon branches are:

- **Isolated**: changes made to a branch don't affect its parent.
- **Fast to create**: creating a branch takes ~1 second, regardless of the size of your database.
- **Cost-effective**: you're only billed for unique data across all branches, and they scale to zero when not in use (you can configure this behavior for every branch).
- **Ready to use**: branches will have the parent branch's schema and all its data (you can also include data up to a certain point in time). If you're working with sensitive data, Neon also supports a schema-only branching option.

Every Neon branch has a unique Postgres connection string, so they're completely isolated from one another.

```bash
# Branch 1
postgresql://database_name_owner:AbC123dEf@ep-shiny-cell-a5y2zuu0.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname

# Branch 2
postgresql://database_name_owner:AbC123dEf@ep-hidden-hall-a5x58cuv.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

You can create all of your branches from the default branch, or set up a dedicated branch that you use as a base. The first approach is simpler, while the second provides greater data isolation.

## Create branch methods

You can use either the Neon CLI or GitHub actions to incorporate branching into your workflow.

### Neon CLI

Using the Neon CLI, you can create branches without leaving your editor or automate branch creation in your CI/CD pipeline.

And here are the key CLI actions you can use:

```bash
# Create branch
neon branches create [options]

# Get Connection string
neon connection-string [branch] [options]

# Delete branch
neon branches delete <id|name> [options]
```

For more information, see:

- [Branching with the Neon CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/branching-neon-cli)
- [Neon CLI Reference](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/neon-cli)

### GitHub Actions

If you're using GitHub Actions for your CI workflows, Neon provides GitHub Actions for creating, deleting, and resetting branches — and there's also a schema diff action.

Here is an example of what a create branch action might look like:

```yaml
name: Create Neon Branch with GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: Create a Neon Branch 🚀
jobs:
  Create-Neon-Branch:
    uses: neondatabase/create-branch-action@v5
    with:
      project_id: rapid-haze-373089
      parent_id: br-long-forest-224191
      branch_name: from_action_reusable
      api_key: {{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
    id: create-branch
  - run: echo project_id ${{ steps.create-branch.outputs.project_id}}
  - run: echo branch_id ${{ steps.create-branch.outputs.branch_id}}
```

Here is an example of what a delete branch action might look like:

```yaml
name: Delete Neon Branch with GitHub Actions
run-name: Delete a Neon Branch 🚀
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'production'
jobs:
  delete-neon-branch:
    uses: neondatabase/delete-branch-action@v3
    with:
      project_id: rapid-haze-373089
      branch: br-long-forest-224191
      api_key: { { secrets.NEON_API_KEY } }
```

## A branch for every environment

Here's how you can integrate Neon branching into your workflow:

### Development

You can create a Neon branch for every developer on your team. This ensures that every developer has an isolated environment that includes schemas and data. These branches are meant to be long-lived, so each developer can tailor their branch based on their needs. With Neon's branch reset capability, developers can refresh their branch with the latest schemas and data anytime they need.

To easily identify branches dedicated to development, we recommend prefixing the branch name with `dev/<developer-name>` or `dev/<feature-name>` if multiple developers collaborate on the same development branch.

Examples:

```bash
dev/alice             dev/new-onboarding
```

### Preview environments

Whenever you create a pull request, you can create a Neon branch for your preview deployment. This allows you to test your code changes and SQL migrations against production-like data.

We recommend following this naming convention to identify these branches easily:

```bash
preview/pr-<pull_request_number>-<git_branch_name>
```

Example:

```bash
preview/pr-123-feat/new-login-screen
```

You can also automate branch creation for every preview. These example applications show how to create Neon branches with GitHub Actions for every preview environment.

- [Preview branches with Vercel](https://github.com/crialabs/preview-branches-with-vercel)

### Testing

When running automated tests that require a database, each test run can have its branch with its own compute resources. You can create a branch at the start of a test run and delete it at the end.

We recommend following this naming convention to identify these branches easily:

```bash
test/<git_branch_name-test_run_name-commit_SHA-time_of_the_test_execution>
```

The time of the test execution can be an epoch UNIX timestamp (e.g., 1704305739). For example:

```bash
test/feat/new-login-loginPageFunctionality-1a2b3c4d-20240211T1530
```

You can create test branches from the same date and time or Log Sequence Number (LSN) for tests requiring static or deterministic data.
