[Neon is available on the Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/neon1722366567200.neon_serverless_postgres_azure_prod?tab=Overview) as an [Azure Native ISV Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/partners), allowing you to work with Neon the same way you work with other native solutions from Microsoft. Billing is handled directly through Azure, and you can choose from Neon pricing plans when deploying the service.

## Key benefits

Deploying Neon natively on Azure lets you manage your Neon organization alongside the rest of your Azure infrastructure. Key benefits include:

- **Azure-native management**: Provision and manage Neon organizations directly from the Azure portal.
- **Single sign-on (SSO)**: Access Neon using your Azure credentialsâ€”no separate logins required.
- **Consolidated billing**: Simplify cost management with unified billing through the Azure Marketplace.
- **Integrated workflows**: Use the Azure CLI and SDKs to manage Neon as part of your regular workflows, integrated with your existing Azure resources.

       **Note**: Management of Neon organizations, projects, and branches is supported via the Azure portal, CLI, and SDK. We continue to enhance the integration between Neon and Azure, including with other Azure native services. Additional Neon features and advanced configurations remain accessible through the Neon Console.
