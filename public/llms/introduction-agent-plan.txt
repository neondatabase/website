## Overview

The Neon agent plan provides infrastructure for platforms that deploy Postgres databases on behalf of end users. The plan uses a two-organization structure to separate free and paid user tiers, with each organization supporting up to 30,000 projects by default.

## Enrollment requirements

To join the agent plan:

- You must have an active Neon paid plan with a credit card on file
- Your application requires approval from the Neon team
- The Neon team handles all organization setup and configuration

Initial enrollment is not self-service. Once approved, the Neon team configures both organizations and grants you admin access. After setup, you manage all projects and configurations independently via the [Neon API](https://neon.com/docs/reference/api-reference).



## Organization structure

Neon creates two organizations in your account:

### Sponsored organization

The sponsored organization hosts databases for your free-tier users at no cost to you. This organization includes the Scale plan features, but individual projects have resource limits similar to Neon's standard free tier.

You are not charged for usage in this organization. Use this for users who haven't upgraded to your platform's paid plans.
For an overview of Free plan limits and Scale plan features, see [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans).

### Paid organization

The paid organization hosts databases for your paying users. This organization includes Scale plan features but with agent-specific pricing. Neon provides $25,000 in initial credits to cover usage charges.

Compute is billed at $0.106 per hour (lower than standard Scale pricing). You can create your own internal tier structure within this organization, configuring different resource quotas for different user segments. Use this organization for users on your paid plans that need resource flexibility.

## Managing projects

After initial enrollment, you have full control over both organizations as admin. Each organization supports 30,000 projects. All project operations are performed through the Neon API. You can:

- Create and delete projects in either organization
- Set per-project resource quotas
- Monitor usage across all projects
- Manage billing limits

This enables fleet management at scale without manual intervention. You can request limit increases through your Neon contact when you approach capacity.

### Project transfers between organizations

With the sponsored and paid organization structure of the agent plan, you can move user projects between organizations when they upgrade or downgrade tiers. Transferring projects between organizations requires a personal API key with access to both organizations. You can transfer up to 400 projects per request.

See [transfer projects between organizations](https://neon.com/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer) for details.

## Pricing

The agent plan uses usage-based pricing with higher rate limits and dedicated support:

| Resource                        | Agent plan                                                                                            |

| Support                         | **Shared Slack Channel**                                                                              |

## Billing model

The paid organization receives $25,000 in initial credits that cover compute ($0.106/hour), storage, and data transfer charges. Usage is tracked per project, and the API exposes consumption metrics for building usage-based billing into your platform.

The sponsored (free) organization has no billing charges.

### Consumption metrics

Track compute time, storage, and network I/O per project to monitor usage and build billing logic. See the [consumption metrics guide](https://neon.com/docs/guides/consumption-metrics) for details.

## Program benefits

The agent plan includes these benefits for participating platforms:

| Benefit                    | Description                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Your Free Tier is free** | Neon sponsors up to 30,000 projects per month used in your sponsored tier.            |
| **General use credits**    | Up to $25,000 in credits for those not eligible for the [Startup Program](https://neon.com/startups). |
| **Co-Marketing**           | Blog and social promotions, hackathons and more.                                      |

2. Create projects in the appropriate organization based on your user's tier
3. Configure resource quotas per project as needed
