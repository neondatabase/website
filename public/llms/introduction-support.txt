These times relate to the time it takes Neon to respond to the Customer's initial request. This guideline only applies when submitting a support ticket through the Neon Console.

| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Severity 1     | Within 4 hours        | Within 1 hour           |
| Severity 2     | Within 1 business day | Within 4 hours          |
| Severity 3     | Within 1 business day | Within 1 business day   |
| Severity 4     | Within 1 business day | Within 1 business day   |

#### Severity levels

When the Customer submits an issue (with or without specifying a starting severity), Neon will reasonably assess its severity according to the appropriate severity levels defined below. Neon reserves the right to set, upgrade and downgrade severities of support tickets, on a case-by-case basis, considering any available mitigations, workarounds, and timely cooperation from Customers. Neon will explain the reasoning to the Customer and will resolve any disagreement regarding the severity as soon as is reasonably practicable. **High severity levels should not be used for low-impact issues or general questions\!**

An explanation of each severity level is provided below.

• **Severity 1** - Production system is down or severely impacted such that routine operation is impossible

• **Severity 2** - Production issue where the system is functioning but in degraded or restricted capacity

• **Severity 3** - Issue where minor functionality is impacted or a development issue occurs

• **Severity 4** - Request for information or feature request with no impact on business operations

### Issue resolution

Neon will make commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any Issues submitted by customers on eligible plans. Such efforts may (at our discretion) include helping with diagnosis, suggesting workarounds, or changing the Product in a new release. An "Issue" is a material and verifiable failure of the Product to conform to its Documentation.

### Billing issues

If you, the Customer, believe that your invoice or billing receipt is incorrect, we strongly encourage you to contact our Support team rather than filing a dispute with your card provider.

Once a dispute has been made with the card provider, the account associated with it and all deployments under it may be suspended until it has been resolved.

Any communication that is deemed objectionable by Neon staff is not tolerated. This includes but is not limited to any communication that is abusive or contains profane language.

#### Enterprise target response times

The table below outlines Neon's guidelines for the various support tiers of our Enterprise support plan.

These times relate to the time it takes Neon to respond to the Customer's initial request. This guideline only applies when submitting a support ticket through the Neon Console.

| Severity Level        | Enterprise Standard                      | Enterprise Gold                         | Enterprise Platinum                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Severity 1 (Critical) | < 2 hours (during Normal Business Hours) | < 1 hour                                | < 1 hour                                |

| Severity 4 (Low)      | < 3 days (during Normal Business Hours)  | < 3 days (during Normal Business Hours) | < 3 days (during Normal Business Hours) |

#### Severity levels

When the Customer submits an issue (with or without specifying a starting severity), Neon will reasonably assess its severity according to the appropriate severity levels defined below. Neon reserves the right to set, upgrade and downgrade severities of support tickets, on a case-by-case basis, considering any available mitigations, workarounds, and timely cooperation from Customers. Neon will explain the reasoning to the Customer and will resolve any disagreement regarding the severity as soon as is reasonably practicable. Critical and High-priority levels should not be used for low-impact issues or general questions!

A detailed explanation of each severity level, including several examples, is provided below.

##### Severity 1 (Critical)

Catastrophic problems in the Customer's production system leading to loss of service or impact on the Customer's business:

- Unavailability of the service
- Security breaches that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the database or its data.

   **Note**: If Critical is selected during the case creation, the customer will be asked to provide in-depth details on the business impact the issue has caused.

Examples:

- A complete outage of the service provided by Neon
- Security breaches
- Error impacting the project as a whole (all endpoints/db affected)
- Error impacting multiple projects
- EP/Branch/DB unreachable
- Data corruption/Data loss

##### Severity 2 (High)

Means a high-impact problem in a customer's production systems. Essential operations are seriously disrupted, but a workaround exists that allows for continued essential operations.

- Non-essential modifications to configuration, like adjusting database parameters or table schema
- Minor performance concerns that have minimal impact on database usability
- Minor issues related to application integrations, such as minor API connectivity problems
- Small-scale challenges with data import/export, data transformation, or data loading processes

Examples:

- Partial outage of the service provided by Neon: service usable, but key feature unusable, e.g.:
  - Cannot create a new branch
  - Cannot execute a branch restore
  - Cannot perform point-in-time recovery (PITR)
  - Etc.
- Any use case that would require a high load of manual work on the customer side to mitigate an issue on our end
- Any use case which massively and negatively affects the customer's business

##### Severity 3 (Normal)

A medium-impact problem on a production or non-production system that involves:

- Partial or limited loss of non-critical functionality
- A usage problem that involves no loss in functionality
- Customers can continue essential operations. Normal problems also include issues with non-production systems, such as test and development systems.

Examples:

- RCA for past outages or incidents (no disruption of the service at the moment)
- Sporadic connection failure/timeouts/retries
- Cannot connect with random third-party framework or tool (but can connect generally speaking)
- Any use case which has a minor impact on the customer's business
- Poor performing queries/ingestion
- Billing issues

##### Severity 4 (Low)

A general usage question; here is no impact on the product's quality, performance, or functionality in a production or non-production system:

- Any request for information, enhancement, or documentation clarification regarding the platform

Examples:

- Feature requests/feature enablement
- General questions ("active time," "how to backup a DB," "how to ingest data") and feedback
- Any use case that has no impact on the customer's business at all
