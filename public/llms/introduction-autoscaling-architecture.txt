A Neon project can have one or more computes, each representing an individual Postgres instance. Storage is decoupled from these computes, meaning that the Postgres servers executing queries are physically separate from the data storage location. This separation offers numerous advantages, including enablement of Neon's autoscaling feature.



Looking more closely, you can see that each Postgres instance operates within its own virtual machine inside a [Kubernetes cluster](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#kubernetes-cluster), with multiple VMs hosted on each node of the cluster. Autoscaling is implemented by allocating and deallocating [vCPU](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#vcpu) and [RAM](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#ram) to each VM.



## The autoscaler-agent

Each [Kubernetes node](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#kubernetes-node) hosts a single instance of the [autoscaler-agent](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#autoscaler-agent), which serves as the control mechanism for Neon's autoscaling system. The agent collects metrics from the VMs on its node, makes scaling decisions, and performs the necessary checks and requests to implement those decisions.

## The Kubernetes scheduler

A Neon-modified [Kubernetes scheduler](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#kubernetes-scheduler) coordinates with the autoscaler-agent and is the single source of truth for resource allocation. The autoscaler-agent obtains approval for all upscaling from the scheduler. The scheduler maintains a global view of all resource usage changes and approves requests for additional resources from the autoscaler-agent or standard scheduling. In this way, the scheduler assumes responsibility for preventing overcommitting of memory resources. In the rare event that a node exhausts its resources, new pods are not scheduled on the node, and the autoscaler-agent is denied permission to allocate more resources.

## NeonVM

Kubernetes does not natively support the creation or management of VMs. To address this, Neon uses a tool called [NeonVM](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#neonvm). This tool is a custom resource definition and controller for VMs, handling tasks such as adding or removing CPUs and memory. Internally, NeonVM utilizes [QEMU](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#qemu) and [KVM](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#kvm) (where available) to achieve near-native performance.

When an autoscaler-agent needs to modify a VM's resource allocation, it simply updates the corresponding NeonVM object in Kubernetes, and the VM controller then manages the rest of the process.

## Live migration

In cases where a Kubernetes node becomes saturated, NeonVM manages the process of [live migrating](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#live-migration) a VM, transferring the VM from one machine to another with minimal interruptions (typically around 100ms). Live migration transmits the internal state of the original VM to a new one while the former continues to operate, swiftly transitioning to the new VM after most of the data is copied. From within the VM, the only indication that a migration occurred might be a temporary performance reduction. Importantly, the VM retains its IP address, ensuring that connections are preserved and queries remain uninterrupted.

The live migration process allows for the proactive reduction of node load by migrating VMs away before reaching capacity. Although it is still possible for the node to fill up in the interim, Neon's separation of storage and compute means that VMs typically use minimal disk space, resulting in fast migrations.

## Memory scaling

Postgres memory consumption can escalate rapidly in specific scenarios. Fortunately, Neon's autoscaling system is able to detect memory usage increases without constantly requesting metrics from the VM. This is accomplished by running Postgres within a [cgroups](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#cgroups), which provides notifications when memory usage crosses a specified threshold. Using cgroups in this way requires running our [vm-monitor](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#vm-monitor) in the VM alongside Postgres to request more resources from the autoscaler-agent when Postgres consumes too much memory. The vm-monitor also verifies that downscaling requests from an autoscaler-agent will leave sufficient memory leftover.

## Local File Cache

To expedite queries, the autoscaling system incorporates a Postgres extension that places a cache in front of the storage layer. Many queries benefit from this additional memory, particularly those requiring multiple database scans (such as creating an index). The [Local File Cache (LFC)](https://neon.com/docs/reference/glossary#local-file-cache) capitalizes on the additional memory allocated to the VM by dedicating a portion to the cache to itself. The cache is backed by disk and kept at a size intended to fit in the kernel page cache. Due to the storage model, writebacks are not required, resulting in near-instant evictions. The vm-monitor adjusts the LFC size when scaling occurs through the autoscaler-agent, ensuring seamless operation.
