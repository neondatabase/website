# Import data from CSV

> The document outlines the process for importing data from CSV files into Neon databases, detailing the necessary steps and commands to execute the import efficiently.

This topic shows how to import data into a Neon database table from a CSV file using a simple example.

The instructions require a working installation of [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). The `psql` client is the native command-line client for Postgres. It provides an interactive session for sending commands to Postgres. For installation instructions, see [How to install psql](https://neon.com/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor#how-to-install-psql).

The following example uses the ready-to-use `neondb` database that is created with your Neon project, a table named `customer`, and a data file named `customer.csv`. Data is loaded from the `customer.csv` file into the `customer` table.

## Connect to your database

Connect to the `neondb` database using `psql`. For example:

```bash
psql "<your_neon_database_connection_string>"
```

You can find your connection string on your Neon Project Dashboard. Click on the **Connect** button. Use the drop-down menu to copy a full `psql` connection command.

   **Note**: For more information about connecting to Neon with `psql`, see [Connect with psql](https://neon.com/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Create the target table

Create the `customer` table — table you are importing to must exist in your database and the columns must match your CSV file.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer (
   id SERIAL,
   first_name VARCHAR(50),
   last_name VARCHAR(50),
   email VARCHAR(255),
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
```

   **Tip**: You can also create tables using the **SQL Editor** in the Neon Console. See [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](https://neon.com/docs/get-started/query-with-neon-sql-editor).

## Prepare the CSV file

Prepare a `customer.csv` file with the following data — note that the columns in the CSV file match the columns in the table you created in the previous step.

```text
First Name,Last Name,Email
1,Casey,Smith,casey.smith@example.com
2,Sally,Jones,sally.jones@example.com
```

## Load the data

From your `psql` prompt, load the data from the `customer.csv` file using the `\copy` option.

```bash
\copy customer FROM '/path/to/customer.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
```

If the command runs successfully, it returns the number of records copied to the database:

```bash
COPY 2
```

For more information about the `\copy` option, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.
