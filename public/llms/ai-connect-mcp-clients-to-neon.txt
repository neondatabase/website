The **Neon MCP Server** allows you to connect various [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.org) compatible AI tools to your Neon Postgres databases. This guide provides instructions for connecting popular MCP clients to the Neon MCP Server, enabling natural language interaction with your Neon projects.

This guide covers the setup for the following MCP clients:

- [Claude Desktop](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#claude-desktop)
- [Claude Code](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#claude-code)
- [Cursor](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#cursor)
- [Windsurf (Codeium)](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#windsurf-codeium)
- [Cline (VS Code extension)](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#cline-vs-code-extension)
- [Zed](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#zed)
- [VS Code (with GitHub Copilot)](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#vs-code-with-github-copilot)
- [ChatGPT](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#chatgpt)

By connecting these tools to the Neon MCP Server, you can manage your Neon projects, databases, and schemas using natural language commands within the MCP client interface.

   **Important** Neon MCP Server Security Considerations: The Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests. **Always review and authorize actions requested by the LLM before execution.** Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server. The Neon MCP Server is intended for local development and IDE integrations only. **We do not recommend using the Neon MCP Server in production environments.** It can execute powerful operations that may lead to accidental or unauthorized changes. For more information, see [MCP security guidance â†’](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#mcp-security-guidance).

## Prerequisites

- An MCP Client application.
- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/signup).
- **Node.js (>= v18.0.0) and npm:** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

For Local MCP Server setup, you also need a Neon API key. See [Neon API Keys documentation](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys).

   **Note**: Ensure you are using the latest version of your chosen MCP client as MCP integration may not be available in older versions. If you are using an older version, update your MCP client to the latest version.

## Connect to Neon MCP Server

You can connect to Neon MCP Server in two ways:

1.  **Remote MCP Server (Preview):** Connect to Neon's managed remote MCP server using OAuth or a Neon API key.
2.  **Local MCP Server:** Install and run the Neon MCP server locally, using a Neon API key.

## Claude Desktop

Tab: Remote MCP Server

1. Open Claude desktop and navigate to **Settings**.
2. Under the **Developer** tab, click **Edit Config** (On Windows, it's under File -> Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config) to open the configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`).
3. Add the "Neon" server entry within the `mcpServers` object:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "Neon": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote@latest", "https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   > To use SSE instead of streamable HTTP responses, you can specify the `https://mcp.neon.tech/sse` endpoint instead of `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp`.

4. Save the configuration file and **restart** Claude Desktop.
5. An OAuth window will open in your browser. Follow the prompts to authorize Claude Desktop to access your Neon account.

> By default, the Remote MCP Server connects to your personal Neon account. To connect to an organization's account, you must authenticate with an API key. For more information, see [API key-based authentication](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#api-key-based-authentication).

Tab: Local MCP Server

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Run the following command, replacing `YOUR_NEON_API_KEY` with your actual Neon API key:

    ```bash
    npx @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon init YOUR_NEON_API_KEY
    ```

3.  Restart Claude Desktop.

## ChatGPT

You can connect ChatGPT to the Neon MCP Server using custom MCP connectors. This integration extends ChatGPT with Neon's database capabilities so you can query, manage, and interact with your Neon projects directly within ChatGPT.



To connect ChatGPT to the Neon MCP Server, you need to first enable ChatGPT's developer mode, then add the Neon MCP Server as a custom connector. This makes the connector available for your account; you'll need to separately enable both developer mode and Neon as a source for any chat where you want to use Neon.

1. **Add MCP server to ChatGPT**

   In your ChatGPT account settings, go to **Settings** â†’ **Connectors** â†’ **Advanced Settings** and enable **Developer mode**.

   Still on the Connectors tab, you can then **create** a Neon connection from the **Browse connectors** section. Use the following URL:

   ```bash
   https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp
   ```

   Make sure you choose **OAuth** for authentication and check "I trust this application", then complete the authorization flow when prompted.

   <div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '0.5rem', margin: '1rem 0'}}>
     <div style={{flex: 1}}>
       
     </div>
     <div style={{flex: 1}}>
       
     </div>
   </div>

2. **Enable Neon per chat**

   In each chat where you want to use Neon, click the **+** button and enable Developer Mode for that chat. Under **Add sources**, you can then enable the Neon connector you just created.

   Once connected, you can use natural language to manage your Neon databases directly in ChatGPT.

## Other MCP clients

Adapt the instructions above for other clients:

- **Remote MCP server:**
  Add the following JSON configuration within the `mcpServers` section of your client's `MCP` configuration file:

  > By default, the Remote MCP Server connects to your personal Neon account. To connect to an organization's account, you must authenticate with an API key. If your client supports it, provide the key in the `Authorization` header. For more information, see [API key-based authentication](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#api-key-based-authentication).

  ```json
  "neon": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote@latest", "https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp"]
  }
  ```

  > MCP supports two remote server transports: the deprecated Server-Sent Events (SSE) and the newer, recommended Streamable HTTP. If your LLM client doesn't support Streamable HTTP yet, you can switch the endpoint from `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` to `https://mcp.neon.tech/sse` to use SSE instead.

  Then follow the OAuth flow on first connection.

- **Local MCP server:**

  Add the following JSON configuration within the `mcpServers` section of your client's `MCP` configuration file, replacing `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key obtained from the [prerequisites](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#prerequisites) section:

  Tab: MacOS/Linux

For **MacOS and Linux**, add the following JSON configuration within the `mcpServers` section of your client's `mcp_config` file, replacing `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key:

  ```json
  "neon": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon", "start", "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"]
  }
  ```

Tab: Windows

For **Windows**, add the following JSON configuration within the `mcpServers` section of your client's `mcp_config` file, replacing `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key:

  ```json
  "neon": {
    "command": "cmd",
    "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon", "start", "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"]
  }
  ```

Tab: Windows (WSL)

For **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**, add the following JSON configuration within the `mcpServers` section of your client's `mcp_config` file, replacing `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key:

  ```json
  "neon": {
    "command": "wsl",
    "args": ["npx", "-y", "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon", "start", "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"]
  }
  ```

     **Note**: After successful configuration, you should see the Neon MCP Server listed as active in your MCP client's settings or tool list. You can enter "List my Neon projects" in the MCP client to see your Neon projects and verify the connection.

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Issues

If your client does not use `JSON` for configuration of MCP servers (such as older versions of Cursor), you can use the following command when prompted:

```bash
# For Remote MCP server
npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp

# For Local MCP server
npx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start <YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>
```

### OAuth Authentication Errors

When using the remote MCP server with OAuth authentication, you might encounter the following error:

```
{"code":"invalid_request","error":"invalid redirect uri"}
```

This typically occurs when there are issues with cached OAuth credentials. To resolve this:

1. Remove the MCP authentication cache directory:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth
   ```
2. Restart your MCP client application
3. The OAuth flow will start fresh, allowing you to properly authenticate

This error is most common when using the remote MCP server option and can occur after OAuth configuration changes or when cached credentials become invalid.

## Next steps

Once connected, you can start interacting with your Neon Postgres databases using natural language commands within your chosen MCP client. Explore the [Supported Actions (Tools)](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#supported-actions-tools) of the Neon MCP Server to understand the available functionalities.
