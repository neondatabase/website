# Connect MCP Clients to Neon

> The document "Connect MCP Clients to Neon" outlines the steps required for Neon users to establish a connection between their MCP clients and the Neon database platform.

## Source

- [Connect MCP Clients to Neon HTML](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon): The original HTML version of this documentation

The **Neon MCP Server** allows you to connect various [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.org) compatible AI tools to your Neon Postgres databases. This guide provides instructions for connecting popular MCP clients to the Neon MCP Server, enabling natural language interaction with your Neon projects.

This guide covers the setup for the following MCP Clients:

- [Claude Desktop](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#claude-desktop)
- [Cursor](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#cursor)
- [Windsurf (Codeium)](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#windsurf-codeium)
- [Cline (VS Code extension)](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#cline-vs-code-extension)
- [Zed](https://neon.com/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon#zed)

By connecting these tools to the Neon MCP Server, you can manage your Neon projects, databases, and schemas using natural language commands within the MCP client interface.

## Prerequisites

- An MCP Client application.
- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/signup).
- **Node.js (>= v18.0.0) and npm:** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

For Local MCP Server setup, you also need a Neon API key. See [Neon API Keys documentation](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys).

   **Note**: Ensure you are using the latest version of your chosen MCP client as MCP integration may not be available in older versions. If you are using an older version, update your MCP client to the latest version.

## Connect to Neon MCP Server

You can connect to Neon MCP Server in two ways:

1.  **Remote MCP Server (Preview):** Connect to Neon's managed remote MCP server using OAuth.
2.  **Local MCP Server:** Install and run the Neon MCP server locally, using a Neon API key.

   **Note**: The remote hosted MCP server is in preview due to the [new OAuth MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/), expect potential changes as we continue to refine the OAuth integration.

## Claude Desktop

Tab: Remote MCP Server

1. Open Claude desktop and navigate to **Settings**.
2. Under the **Developer** tab, click **Edit Config** (On Windows, it's under File -> Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config) to open the configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`).
3. Add the "Neon" server entry within the `mcpServers` object:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "Neon": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.neon.tech/sse"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Save the configuration file and **restart** Claude Desktop.
5. An OAuth window will open in your browser. Follow the prompts to authorize Claude Desktop to access your Neon account.

Tab: Local MCP Server

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Run the following command, replacing `YOUR_NEON_API_KEY` with your actual Neon API key:

    ```bash
    npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install neon --client claude --config "{\"neonApiKey\":\"YOUR_NEON_API_KEY\"}"
    ```

3.  Restart Claude Desktop.

## Other MCP clients

Adapt the instructions above for other clients:

- **Remote MCP server:**
  Add the following JSON configuration within the `mcpServers` section of your client's `MCP` configuration file:

  ```json
  "neon": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.neon.tech/sse"]
  }
  ```

  Then follow the OAuth flow on first connection.

- **Local MCP server:** Use the Smithery command:

  ```bash
  npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install neon --client <client_name> --config "{\"neonApiKey\":\"YOUR_NEON_API_KEY\"}"
  ```

  Replace `YOUR_NEON_API_KEY` with your actual Neon API key.
  Replace `<client_name>` with the name of your MCP client application. Supported client names include:

  - `claude` for [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
  - `cursor` for [Cursor](https://cursor.com) (Installing via `smithery` makes the MCP server a global MCP server in Cursor)
  - `windsurf` for [Windsurf Editor](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
  - `roo-cline` for [Roo Cline VS Code extension](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code)
  - `witsy` for [Witsy](https://witsyai.com/)
  - `enconvo` for [Enconvo](https://www.enconvo.com/)
  - `vscode` for [Visual Studio Code (Preview)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)

If your MCP client is not listed here, you can manually add the Neon MCP Server details to your client's `mcp_config` file. The specific configuration varies slightly depending on your operating system.

Tab: MacOS/Linux

For **MacOS and Linux**, add the following JSON configuration within the `mcpServers` section of your client's `mcp_config` file, replacing `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key:

```json
"neon": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon", "start", "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"]
}
```

Tab: Windows

For **Windows**, add the following JSON configuration within the `mcpServers` section of your client's `mcp_config` file, replacing `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key:

```json
"neon": {
  "command": "cmd",
  "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon", "start", "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"]
}
```

Tab: Windows (WSL)

For **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**, add the following JSON configuration within the `mcpServers` section of your client's `mcp_config` file, replacing `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key:

```json
"neon": {
  "command": "wsl",
  "args": ["npx", "-y", "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon", "start", "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"]
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your Neon API key.

   **Note**: After successful configuration, you should see the Neon MCP Server listed as active in your MCP client's settings or tool list. You can enter "List my Neon projects" in the MCP client to see your Neon projects and verify the connection.

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Issues

If your client does not use `JSON` for configuration of MCP servers (such as older versions of Cursor), you can use the following command when prompted:

```bash
# For Remote MCP server
npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.neon.tech/sse

# For Local MCP server
npx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start <YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>
```

### OAuth Authentication Errors

When using the remote MCP server with OAuth authentication, you might encounter the following error:

```
{"code":"invalid_request","error":"invalid redirect uri"}
```

This typically occurs when there are issues with cached OAuth credentials. To resolve this:

1. Remove the MCP authentication cache directory:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth
   ```
2. Restart your MCP client application
3. The OAuth flow will start fresh, allowing you to properly authenticate

This error is most common when using the remote MCP server option and can occur after OAuth configuration changes or when cached credentials become invalid.

## Next steps

Once connected, you can start interacting with your Neon Postgres databases using natural language commands within your chosen MCP client. Explore the [Supported Actions (Tools)](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#supported-actions-tools) of the Neon MCP Server to understand the available functionalities.
