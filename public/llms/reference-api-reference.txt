# Neon API

> The Neon API documentation outlines the endpoints and methods for interacting programmatically with Neon databases, enabling users to manage database instances, configurations, and operations through HTTP requests.

## Source

- [Neon API HTML](https://neon.com/docs/reference/api-reference): The original HTML version of this documentation

The Neon API allows you to manage your Neon projects programmatically.

Refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) for supported methods.

The Neon API is a REST API. It provides resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and supports standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Authentication

The Neon API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage API keys for your account in the Neon Console. For instructions, refer to [Manage API keys](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys).

The client must send an API key in the Authorization header when making requests, using the bearer authentication scheme. For example:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

## Neon API base URL

The base URL for a Neon API request is:

```text
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/
```

Append a Neon API method path to the base URL to construct the full URL for a request. For example:

```text
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}
```

## Using the Neon API reference to construct and execute requests

You can use the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) to execute Neon API requests. Select an endpoint, enter an API key token in the **Bearer** field in the **Authorization** section, and supply any required parameters and properties. For information about obtaining API keys, see [Manage API keys](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys).

The [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) also provides request and response body examples that you can reference when constructing your own requests.

For additional Neon API examples, refer to the following topics:

- [View operations with the Neon API](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations#operations-and-the-neon-api)

   **Important**: When using the Neon API programmatically, you can poll the operation `status` to ensure that an operation is finished before proceeding with the next API request. For more information, see [Poll operation status](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations#poll-operation-status).
