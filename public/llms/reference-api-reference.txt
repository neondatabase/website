# Neon API

> The Neon API allows you to manage your Neon projects programmatically — create and manage projects, branches, databases, roles, compute endpoints, and more. Everything you can do in the Neon Console, you can do with the API.

## Quick links

- [OpenAPI Specification](https://neon.com/api_spec/release/v2.json) — Machine-readable API spec (OpenAPI 3.0)
- [Neon SDKs](https://neon.com/docs/reference/sdk) — TypeScript and Python SDKs for the Neon API

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before using the Neon API, you need:

1. **A Neon account** — Sign up at https://console.neon.tech/signup
2. **An API key** — Create one in the Neon Console under Account settings > API keys
3. **curl or an HTTP client** — Or use the TypeScript or Python SDKs

### API key types

Neon supports three types of API keys:

| Key Type | Scope | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Personal API Key** | All projects you own or have access to | Personal development, scripts |
| **Organization API Key** | All projects within an organization | Team automation, CI/CD |
| **Project-scoped API Key** | Single project only | Limited access integrations |

**Important:** API key tokens are shown only once at creation. Store them securely — you cannot retrieve them later.

For detailed instructions, see [Manage API keys](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys).

### Base URL

All API requests use this base URL:

```text
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/
```

### Authentication

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using Bearer authentication:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

## Make your first API call

Set your API key as an environment variable, then list your projects.

### Using curl

```bash
# Set your API key
export NEON_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# List all projects
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

### Using the TypeScript SDK

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/api-client
```

```typescript
import { createApiClient } from '@neondatabase/api-client';

const apiClient = createApiClient({
  apiKey: process.env.NEON_API_KEY!,
});

async function listProjects() {
  const response = await apiClient.listProjects({});
  console.log(response.data.projects);
}

listProjects();
```

### Using the Python SDK

```bash
pip install neon-api
```

```python
import os
from neon_api import NeonAPI

neon = NeonAPI(api_key=os.environ["NEON_API_KEY"])

projects = neon.projects()
print(projects)
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "id": "spring-example-302709",
      "name": "my-project",
      "region_id": "aws-us-east-2",
      "pg_version": 17,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create a branch

Use the `project_id` from the response to create a branch:

**curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/spring-example-302709/branches' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"branch": {"name": "dev-branch"}}'
```

**TypeScript SDK:**
```typescript
const response = await apiClient.createProjectBranch('spring-example-302709', {
  branch: { name: 'dev-branch' },
});
console.log(response.data.branch);
```

**Python SDK:**
```python
branch = neon.branch_create(
    project_id="spring-example-302709",
    branch={"name": "dev-branch"}
)
print(branch)
```

## Key concepts

### Asynchronous operations

Many Neon API operations (creating branches, starting computes, etc.) are asynchronous. The API response includes an `operations` array with status information:

```json
"operations": [
  {
    "id": "22acbb37-209b-4b90-a39c-8460090e1329",
    "action": "create_branch",
    "status": "running"
  }
]
```

**Status values:** `scheduling`, `running`, `finished`, `failed`, `cancelling`, `cancelled`, `skipped`

When building automation, poll the operation status before proceeding with dependent requests:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/{project_id}/operations/{operation_id}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

For details, see [Poll operation status](https://neon.com/docs/manage/operations#poll-operation-status).

### Rate limiting

- **700 requests per minute** (approximately 11 per second)
- **40 requests per second** burst limit per route

Exceeding these limits returns `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in your applications.

### Pagination

Some endpoints that return lists support cursor-based pagination. Include `limit` and `cursor` parameters:

```bash
# First request with limit
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects?limit=10' ...

# Subsequent request with cursor from previous response
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects?limit=10&cursor=...' ...
```

## SDKs and tools

Instead of using curl, you can use official SDKs:

- **[TypeScript SDK](https://neon.com/docs/reference/typescript-sdk)** — Full-featured SDK for Node.js and browser
- **[Python SDK](https://neon.com/docs/reference/python-sdk)** — Pythonic wrapper for the Neon API
- **[@neondatabase/toolkit](https://neon.com/docs/reference/neondatabase-toolkit)** — Combined SDK for AI agents (includes API SDK + Serverless Driver)
- **[Neon CLI](https://neon.com/docs/reference/neon-cli)** — Command-line interface for Neon

See [Neon SDKs](https://neon.com/docs/reference/sdk) for the full list, including community SDKs.

## API reference documentation

The interactive [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) provides:

- Complete endpoint documentation
- Request/response examples
- "Try It" feature to execute requests directly
- Schema definitions for all objects

You can also access the [OpenAPI specification](https://neon.com/api_spec/release/v2.json) directly for code generation or API tooling.
