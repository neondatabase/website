## Use logical replication for near-zero downtime data migrations

Postgres logical replication in Neon provides an efficient way to migrate data from other Postgres providers with minimal downtime. By replicating data in real-time, this method allows you to transition your applications to Neon without interrupting your services. Please refer to our logical replication guides for instructions.
