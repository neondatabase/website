# Neon data migration guides

> This guide provides an overview of all available data migration options for Neon Postgres, including tools for migrating from various database providers, using logical replication for near-zero downtime migrations, and importing sample datasets for testing.

Find instructions for migrating data from Postgres, CSV, other Neon projects, and other database providers. For near-zero downtime data migrations from other Postgres providers, consider using logical replication. Additionally, if you're new to Neon and want to try it out, our sample data guide provides datasets for exploration and testing.

## Use logical replication for near-zero downtime data migrations

Postgres logical replication in Neon provides an efficient way to migrate data from other Postgres providers with minimal downtime. By replicating data in real-time, this method allows you to transition your applications to Neon without interrupting your services. Please refer to our logical replication guides for instructions.
